00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:10,059


4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:14,010
SPEAKER 1: All right, this
is CS50, and this is week 11.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:17,700
Before we begin today, I thought
we'd make some changes in light

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,800
of the competition on the horizon.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,560
First and foremost, this
is perhaps in order.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,190
And I was down the street
just earlier, and I

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,390
got my shirt for the weekend,
which I gather means 900.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,000
So good luck this weekend.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,150
And before we proceed further, a big
thanks to the whole team, honestly,

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,599
that made this semester possible--

13
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,390
Natalie, in particular,
who I'm sure you've

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,765
gotten to know over time, of
course, Benedict with whom I

15
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:43,290
went to college some years ago.

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,850
You recall this picture from week
0, and then of course [? Stelios ?]

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,220
and [? Anusery ?] and the
whole team of TAs and CAs here.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,380
And, indeed, this is actually
a pretty novel thing.

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,213
If you haven't quite
realized it, especially

20
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:59,568
if you're first year, having
undergraduate ULAs [CRASH] or tada.

21
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:00,870
[LAUGHS]

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,170
That's anticlimactic.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,650
OK, so we will tend to this later.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,480
So this is actually
a pretty novel thing,

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,480
that there are undergraduates teaching
assistants, that you guys can actually

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,670
teach your own classes,
hold office hours, and more.

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,190
And this was actually initiated
just a few years ago by way

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,150
of CS50's first class of TAs and CAs.

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,090
So here's a [INAUDIBLE]
article from back in 2015.

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,880
In fact, this is the very
first team of undergraduate CAs

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,580
who first TAed CS50 itself.

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,310
And in fact, this is now an opportunity
that has extended beyond CS50 itself.

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,310
So if you're thinking about computer
science or really any related field

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,268
and you might like to start teaching--
which frankly is by far the best

35
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:41,820
way to actually learn and
absorb this kind of material--

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,290
realize that CS50 itself will soon start
recruiting, and we and the whole team

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,490
would indeed love to
have you on the team.

38
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,200
And even if you are among or were
among those less comfortable,

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,140
keep in mind that's what we
said in the first lecture still

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,220
holds true here on out.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,290
What really matters
ultimately in this class,

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,810
even if it might not quite feel
like this-- it's just what?

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,690
Four hours after the quiz was due--

44
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,400
that what really matters in
this course is not so much

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,750
where you end up relative
to your classmates,

46
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,639
but where you end up
relative to yourselves.

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,410
And that's something
we have and will keep

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,680
in mind, especially when it comes time
for final projects, grades, and beyond.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,610
And in fact, these were
the percentages broken down

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,740
in the very first lecture based
on problem set zero of this year.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,680
So those of you who have
been feeling that you

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,380
are among those less comfortable realize
that it's no longer by definition

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,880
the case.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,730
Everyone's been upgraded to
somewhere in between or among those

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,950
more comfortable, and
realize this is perhaps

56
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,200
just the first such stepping stone.

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,910
So this has been a tradition of having
undergrads TA the class for years

58
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,720
up in Cambridge.

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,840
And in fact, the team there put
together with our production team

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,720
a little invitation for you
to consider joining us here

61
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,530
in New Haven among our CAs
and TAs for the coming year.

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,324
So allow me to dim the lights and
have our team in Cambridge say hello.

63
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:54,990
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,160
- I'm Elsiah.

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,120
- My name is Nenia.

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
- I'm Athena Braun.

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,950
- I'm a sophomore.

68
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,000
- I'm a senior.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,150
- I'm a junior studying in
computer science and linguistics.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,680
- I'm concentrating in [? CSL. ?]

71
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,950
- CS50 is always just
because it's changed my life.

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,230
It made me a computer
science concentrator.

73
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,090
- I'm a TF for CS50.

74
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,930
- Course assistant.

75
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,388
- This is my second year TFing now.

76
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:17,610
- This is my third year being
a teaching fellow for CS50.

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,510
- Becoming part of CF's staff
helped empower me so so so much.

78
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,650
- I was a total beginner, never
anticipated programming beyond CS50.

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,420
But here I am.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,320
This is something I
never thought I would do.

81
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,850
I think it's just been really
exciting going from being a beginner

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,480
to being comfortable
enough to TF this class.

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,050
- Everything that has
come out of this has

84
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,700
helped me grow so much as
a teacher, as a student.

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,205
- Also the culture and the
environment of it is also pretty.

86
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:51,440
- I've definitely found a community
of friends within the CS50 staff.

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,099
- Be prepared to have
students who look up to you

88
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,140
and really appreciate the
work that you're doing.

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,890
And just realize that you're
not just a teaching fellow.

90
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,950
You're not just this person
behind the whiteboard.

91
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,080
You're like a student
who took this, too,

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,320
and can really level with
other people in your section

93
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,330
and figure out what's going on and
make it a good experience for them.

94
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,681
- I decided that I can get
the best of both worlds.

95
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,430
I can get to teach
about computer science.

96
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,320
And those are two are my passions.

97
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,099
- I just really love teaching
computer science to beginners.

98
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,780
CS50 is where all that
beginner energy is,

99
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,940
and it's where I can make a real
impact on the students' careers in CS.

100
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,290
- It's amazing to see how much this
course can do in just a semester

101
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,310
and how, from September until
December, students learn so much

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,429
and gain so much
experience and knowledge.

103
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,720
And watching that and working
with them in that process

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,430
has always been really,
really inspiring.

105
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,520
- It's been so so wonderful
getting to see these people grow,

106
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
just like I did myself.

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,803
- One of the most rewarding
things I've done here.

108
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,770
So that's why I keep coming back.

109
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,917
- Going to office hours and helping
people out, it makes you feel good.

110
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,750
And it makes other
people feel good as well.

111
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,541
- My name is Brian.

112
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,442
- I'm Thomas Lively.

113
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,025
- I'm Allison.

114
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,040
- I'm Maria.

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,770
And this is CS50.

116
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,700
[END PLAYBACK]

117
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,494
SPEAKER 1: So realize, here in
New Haven and also in Cambridge,

118
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,410
we're fortunate to have
quite a few resources,

119
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,493
both in terms of the place that we're
in and the people that we're around.

120
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,080
And one of the focuses of CS50
for years now with its staff

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,746
has been on something called open
courseware, whereby we've long

122
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:21,982
made the courses, videos, and problem
sets and software freely available

123
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,190
to everyone around the world.

124
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,810
And just a couple of
years, too, did we start

125
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,518
to focus, not just on
students who wanted

126
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:29,340
to tune in in any country and
any city, have we also started

127
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,060
focusing on teachers as well so that
they needn't rely only on the textbooks

128
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,270
that their schools provide but too
can get on the internet and tune into

129
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,910
and use in their own
classrooms, adapting or adopting

130
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,100
this particular curriculum and
tools for their own students.

131
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,580
And if curious, for instance,
every red dot on this map

132
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,260
actually represents some
cohort of high school students

133
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,101
and high school teachers teaching
introductory [? CFs ?] via CF50AP

134
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,600
as it's called, and every one
of the blue dots on the screen

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,660
represents a university with whom
we've been collaborating in some form,

136
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
either formally with some
of the faculty or less

137
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,618
formally with some of
the student groups there.

138
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,470
And so if you're interests in
education and in computer science

139
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,870
extend beyond, by all
means consider applying,

140
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,900
not only to TA or SA the
class, but to get involved

141
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,320
in these other outreach efforts
creating curricula, working on tools,

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,910
and really making an impact.

143
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,790
In fact, the communities
beyond Cambridge and New Haven

144
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,160
include Miami Dade in Florida.

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,330
This is Chile.

146
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,760
This is our team in London.

147
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,170
Here in Burma.

148
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,450
Here in Ukraine.

149
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,130
Here in Cairo.

150
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,560
Here in Bolivia and Nicaragua, and
then lastly back home in Cambridge.

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,810
This was our very first
cohort of high school teachers

152
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,540
who came to town in order to
bring a little something back

153
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,110
to their own classrooms and
teach and adapt as well there.

154
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,270
And in fact, just a
few years ago, apropos

155
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,710
of the event on our own horizon, this
was the very first CF50AP hackathon,

156
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,950
whereas instead of getting
together at 7:00 PM To 7:00 AM,

157
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,980
we got together like 10 AM to 2 PM
during the high school schedule.

158
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,380
And we had eight public
and private high schools

159
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,800
in the New York City area come together
to work on their own problems sets

160
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,510
and final projects and the like.

161
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,000
So again, if of interest, do
you feel welcome to engage

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
with us and so many people
around the world in that way.

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,930
So what have we actually done in the
classroom and in the problem sets?

164
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,305
So at the end of the day, it's
all about problem solving.

165
00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:16,230
And hopefully, if you
attended CF50 Puzzle Day

166
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,938
or certainly engaged in the problems
over the past several weeks,

167
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,374
you realize that the goals of this class
are not so much to teach you C per se,

168
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,290
and it doesn't really
matter some of the finer

169
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,456
implementation details of
a lot of the problem sets,

170
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:29,550
but how you went about
solving those problems.

171
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,126
And we claimed early on
that there is a methodology,

172
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,500
and there's techniques with
which you can solve problems.

173
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,620
And indeed, we hope what you exit
the course with is sort of an ability

174
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,710
now to recognize patterns and other
problems you might encounter, not

175
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,020
just in CS, but in other fields too.

176
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,480
If curious as to how
some of your classmates

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,270
perceived this year's problem
sets, we took a look at the data

178
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,720
that you kindly provided
in problems set eight.

179
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,670
This is a bar chart of what
everyone thought of the problem set.

180
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,380
So purple is hate.

181
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,490
Blue is love.

182
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,530
So it's hate on top down
to love on the bottom.

183
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,880
And so what you can see here is
that love was kind of invariant,

184
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,260
though there was even more liking
of problem sets 6 over here.

185
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,630
No one really hated
problems set 1, which

186
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,715
is fantastic, with Mario and the likes.

187
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:16,590
So perhaps you're
somewhere in that spectrum.

188
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,950
A little more telling was this.

189
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,500
How difficult were the problem sets?

190
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,380
And these numbers varied a lot more.

191
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,330
[? P ?] said 0 and 1 were very
blue because blue is easy,

192
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,520
green meanwhile on the
top would represent hard.

193
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,890
So there's definitely
some fluctuation based

194
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,460
on expectations of the problem sets and
which one were newer or in progress.

195
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,937
But problem set 5--

196
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:37,020
so misspellings, the spellcheckers--
it's probably pretty fair to say it's

197
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,450
pretty orange and a bunch
of green, whereas pset

198
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,120
6 kind of went the other direction,
where you had the ability

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,910
to port some of our
programs from C to Python

200
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,640
and implement some document similarity.

201
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,170
When did you start problem sets?

202
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,210
More telling.

203
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,710
So [INAUDIBLE] called that they are
released way over here on a Friday,

204
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,550
but the most common day seems to be
Wednesday followed by Friday, followed

205
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,750
by Thursday.

206
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,140
Thankfully zero people said they
started it the morning of it being due.

207
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,550
So that's a little something.

208
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,827
And then lastly, when
did you watch lectures?

209
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,660
So it seems that Monday
was the common case.

210
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,810
Some folks tuned in live on Friday
or watched it on demand thereafter,

211
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,460
Saturday, Sunday being common.

212
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,460
And then there's perhaps
correlation between the blue Sunday

213
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,710
and the blue Sunday for
problem sets as well.

214
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,510
So just to give you a sense
of your own patterns as well.

215
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,740
So where did we begin?

216
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,950
So you recalled that we came
on up here some 12 weeks ago

217
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,152
and played this, IVs hardest game,
which was a game written in Scratch

218
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:34,110
but was all about trying
to solve some problem.

219
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,470
And we distilled this notion of problem
solving really into this black box.

220
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,190
At the end of the day, all problem
solving is is you've got some input--

221
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,980
and we happen to represent them
in so many different ways, zeros

222
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,610
and ones, letters of the alphabet,
colors and files, and web requests,

223
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,330
and more.

224
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,060
But at the end of the day, what
you care about is the outputs.

225
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,670
And the secret sauce in the
middle, we've kept calling what?

226
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,060


227
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,390
OK, you're wearing the I took CF50
shirt, so you better have an answer.

228
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,615
What's inside the box?

229
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,190
Grhythms, exactly.

230
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,781
Yeah, algorithms is this
sort of fancy sounding term

231
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:15,030
that really is just these step by step
instructions for solving some problems.

232
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,222
And whether we've solve these problems
in Scratch or in C or in Python

233
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:20,930
or in [? Secord ?] or in JavaScript,
these really are just tools.

234
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,140
And hopefully you found,
albeit with deliberately

235
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,890
a bit of frustration
in recent weeks where

236
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,460
you had to Google a bit more on your
own or you had to ask more questions,

237
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,777
hopefully you felt--

238
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,610
though perhaps not
pleasurably at the time--

239
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,980
that the training wheels were
really starting to come off

240
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,010
and that the expectations were more on
your end to sort of figure something

241
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,510
out.

242
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,220
But hopefully, we hope you had
the right mental model with which

243
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,170
to figure out what resources to use and
how to go about solving those problems.

244
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,700
And so indeed, allow us
to propose to you what you

245
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,040
can do after CF50, very pragmatically.

246
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,650
If your interest lies specifically
in software development,

247
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,400
you'll hear at the end
of today's lecture,

248
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,990
too, a number of other directions you
can go, particularly by way of classes

249
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,005
but with j term on the horizon
and summer on the horizon

250
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,867
and perhaps jobs on
some of your minds, we

251
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,700
thought we'd give you a glimpse of
just some of the practical things

252
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,991
that you might want to keep
in mind that will generally

253
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:12,750
be assumed by some other
high level systems classes.

254
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,160
But just how can you write
code and solve problems

255
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,810
without CS50, without CS50 [? ide, ?]
and certainly without a problem

256
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,820
set specification that
just tells you what to do?

257
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,087
So learning git.

258
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:27,170
This is something you've used underneath
the hood for some amount of time,

259
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,919
and there's many
different implementations

260
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,460
of this notion of version control.

261
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,750
And git is not the only one.

262
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,190
It's perhaps the most
popular these days.

263
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,023
So many of the things
we'll suggest here you

264
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:38,002
could absolutely sub
out for something else.

265
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:39,710
But this certainly is
very much in vogue.

266
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,960
And so if you go to this
URL here at some point,

267
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,090
CF50 own Brian or
[? Hadeie ?] in Cambridge

268
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,670
did a fantastic seminar
on how to learn git.

269
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,415
We'll post all these slides on
the website after today as well.

270
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:53,450
And here's Brian from
that very same thing.

271
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,720
If you want to keep your own projects,
whether academically or professionally

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,660
private, GitHub's great about
giving you free access to this.

273
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,170
So even though all your work thus
far has been in CF50's account,

274
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,500
our organization called [INAUDIBLE]
50, you can head here and actually

275
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,750
sign up for free accounts
to continue using that,

276
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,450
and you'll see a little
screen a bit like this.

277
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,520
Installing git on your
own Mac or PC-- and this

278
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,770
is where really you can
force yourself to take off

279
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,970
some of the training wheels.

280
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,110
CF50 ide is meant to be pretty
representative of a real world software

281
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,177
development environment.

282
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,510
But it's of course, cloud based.

283
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,630
And even I get annoyed if I'm taken
Amtrak down here from Cambridge trying

284
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,480
to use it because of the latency
or weak internet connection,

285
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,440
and I don't necessarily have as much
control as I might on my own Mac or PC.

286
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,830
And so among the options, of course, are
to install these very same tools there,

287
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,090
among them a text editor.

288
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,970
There's dozens of these if
not hundreds over the years.

289
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,640
One of the most popular perhaps
is called Sublime Text, which

290
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,230
you can download at this URL here.

291
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,630
And this would be the equivalent
of the little tab code

292
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,000
windows that just come with CF50 ide.

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,010
But you can use it on your own computer.

294
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,100
And you'll see a little something
like this with nice and fancy features

295
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,933
that are intellectually
interesting but just

296
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,210
save you time at the end of the day.

297
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,450
Atom is a very popular one as well,
which you can take a look at online,

298
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,170
too.

299
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,670
It, too, is freely available.

300
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,770
And then Vim and more
command line based tools.

301
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,737
Actually, to this day
I still use Vim myself.

302
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:11,570
If you've ever seen me in lecture
open a black and white window that

303
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,510
isn't the tabbed code window
but via plug-ins and the like,

304
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,080
can you make this type of tool and
others like it, [? EMAX ?] and beyond,

305
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,900
ever more versatile as well.

306
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,800
Besides that, in FAQ, apropos
of final projects coming up,

307
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,290
is that many students end up
doing mobile applications,

308
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,040
even though we don't teach it per se,
web applications, which we introduce

309
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,127
you to by way of pset 7 and pset 8.

310
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,960
So a very common approach as you're
thinking about over Thanksgiving

311
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,221
and beyond your final projects
is that, if you actually

312
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,970
want to put these
things out there and not

313
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,094
think of it as just meeting the
course's own expectations but something

314
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:46,010
you really want to build
on and it's something

315
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,560
you want to do for your student group
or your own entrepreneurial effort

316
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,434
or for some other class for what
you want to solve some problem using

317
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:55,900
software, realize you can put these
things out there using CF50 ide.

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,810
For instance, if you go to the
Share button in our own ide,

319
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,290
you'll see an interface like this.

320
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,960
And so long as you make the
so-called application public,

321
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,630
then anyone on the
internet can visit that URL

322
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,102
and try out your CF50 finance or your
mashup or now your final project.

323
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:11,810
Of course, with these
free accounts, they

324
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,143
tend to shut off after some
number of hours of idleness.

325
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:16,490
So it's not the way to run
a website that you actually

326
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,450
want friends to use for some time.

327
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,080
So using things like [INAUDIBLE]
is a very popular service.

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
And ask any of the TAs
or staff over time,

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,180
and we'll post some links online
as well to get started on this.

330
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,300
AWS, Amazon's cloud service,
and Microsoft has one,

331
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,470
and Google has one as well.

332
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,300
Can you sign up for free accounts there.

333
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,760
And you can actually get
your own free domain names.

334
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,468
If this is of interest
and you don't want

335
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,300
it to be some cryptic
sounding domain name,

336
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,690
you can actually get them from free from
companies like namecheap and the like,

337
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,390
leveraging your student
status for the next few years

338
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,140
to take advantage of all
these resources for free.

339
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,089
And this one in particular
at GitHub's address

340
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,130
gives you access to a lot
of tools that you might

341
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,000
want to experiment with and try out.

342
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,210
So where will we head
in the coming days?

343
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,470
The sort of hardest parts, perhaps, are
behind us, with the test and the quiz

344
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,887
and all of the problem sets, and all
that remains now is the final project.

345
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:09,470
And the hope here really is to
take all of the training wheels

346
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,330
off and give you a
chance to sort of build

347
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,680
something that's genuinely of interest.

348
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,360
Hopefully it will solve
some problem of interest

349
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,317
to you or, again, your student group,
or something you're working on.

350
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,150
And you'll have 12 hours if you'd
like to join us in Cambridge, just

351
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,720
as your predecessors did last year, to
hop on a bus in just a couple of weeks

352
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,230
time.

353
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,230
Come on down to Cambridge
for a 7:00 PM or so start.

354
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,700
Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by
the staff from Cambridge and New Haven

355
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,510
alike.

356
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,450
You'll get settled down
and grab a name tag

357
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,020
and find a place to sit
and work on your laptops

358
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,580
for pretty much throughout the night.

359
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,890
The goal is to actually
get something useful done.

360
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,237
Ideally it is now to
start your final project,

361
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,070
since starting it at
the middle of the night

362
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,486
is probably not the best strategy.

363
00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:51,650
And in fact, if you take nothing
else away in the way of advice today,

364
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,320
get something done over
Thanksgiving truly,

365
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,530
even if it's just hello world,
if you're making an iOS app,

366
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,370
or hello world if you're making
Android, or copying problem set 7

367
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,590
or problem set 8 and
then building upon it

368
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,400
or starting to for your final project.

369
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,772
Just like give yourself
that base layer on top

370
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:10,980
of which you can build when you actually
arrive at an event like this or dive

371
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,374
in on your own.

372
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:15,290
The evening will be punctuated by
opportunities to ask the staff help.

373
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,120
But it won't be like 12
hours of office hours.

374
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,730
The staff will be there, but generally
working on their own projects

375
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,688
and there to advise you
or point you at things,

376
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,510
but not necessarily to solve
problems in the same way,

377
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,910
since your projects will be as
unfamiliar to us as they are to you.

378
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,730
But we'll point you
at what we might know.

379
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,690
And it'll be an opportunity
really just to have

380
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,720
what we hope is a pretty memorable
collegiate experience, working

381
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,320
on final projects, having some Mexican
food around 9 PM, pizza around 1:00 AM.

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,554
And then if beyond the photo
booth and other distractions,

383
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,720
if you need a little break
here and there, including

384
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,920
a therapy dog this year--

385
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,370
Milo-- and naps throughout the
evening, as happened last year as well,

386
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,730
if you make it all the way
to 5:00 AM, one of the buses,

387
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,230
if you're still up for it, I'm
on the way back to New Haven.

388
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,034
We'll stop off at IHOP for
breakfast for those still awake.

389
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,700
And if you're too tired at that
point, one of the other shuttles

390
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,030
will head back in a different
direction altogether.

391
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,780
And then the CF50 fair, which is here
in New Haven for all Yale students

392
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,582
and faculty and staff to come to.

393
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,290
This is meant to be
an opportunity really

394
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,194
to delight in what you pull off over
the remaining weeks of the class

395
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:21,319
and really what you accomplished over
the course of the semester since week

396
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,890
0.

397
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,460
Last year's event was in Commons,
which is currently offline, but has

398
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,250
over 1,000 people of students
and staff and faculty

399
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,470
coming by to really see
what you've worked on.

400
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,940
And it's a very casual environment.

401
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,398
There's music, and there's
friends from industry and alumni

402
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,449
there to chat up everyone is well.

403
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,990
And here's a group of students
presenting their final project

404
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,417
last year, the same kind
of thing happening here,

405
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,750
and then even some hardware
demonstrations like this one

406
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,616
involving VR.

407
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:48,740
So it's really just a fun opportunity
to get everyone together before break

408
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,860
to see what everyone has accomplished
over the course of the term.

409
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,110
And alumni, indeed, come
back from Facebook and Google

410
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,470
and the like to chat up folks about
opportunities in the real world

411
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,254
as well.

412
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,920
And at the end of it all, in
addition to cotton candy, as you'll

413
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,330
see we have we have
and before then, your I

414
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,980
took CF50 t-shirt to claim
hopefully proudly exactly that.

415
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,737
An invitation though
is certainly warranted.

416
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:16,820
This year's event will be in a fairly
special place, no longer in Commons,

417
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,460
but in the Peabody Museum,
if you've ever been there.

418
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,180
So in addition to the very modern
things like laptops and apps, well

419
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,550
you'll also see some
things from yesteryear.

420
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,670
Let's take a look, in fact, what awaits.

[END PLAYBACK]

429
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,170
SPEAKER 1: So at the very end of today's
lecture, after we take a look at some

430
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,350
follow on classes and CS, you'll
be joined, as is our tradition,

431
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,270
by the staff for some cake in back.

432
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,567
So do join us and the faculty you
were with us today for exactly that.

433
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,650
I thought we'd conclude our beginning
portion of the lecture 2 with a look

434
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,070
back at this semester, but again, in
addition to this very practical advice

435
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,030
in these next steps that we've offered,
do keep in mind that we hope ultimately

436
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,690
that, since week 0 now
here in week 11, you really

437
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,790
do feel empowered and
all the more equipped

438
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,420
to explore other fields of
other areas of computer science.

439
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,414
But even if you choose for CS50
or any other science classes

440
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,330
to be your last, that you can now
bring to bear some of these concepts

441
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,954
and these practical skills back
to the arts and the humanities,

442
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:49,960
social sciences, and beyond to actually
solve problems using computing and data

443
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,010
all the more effectively.

444
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,550
So in a final sentimental note, a
look back at CF50 this past year

been going, how well you guys have all

And we really want to see you
all around the department.

479
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,132
So I'm going to talk for a little
bit about some of the classes

480
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,090
that we're offering in the spring
that we think you should all consider

481
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,514
and that you're all ready to take.

482
00:22:01,514 --> 00:22:03,930
And then I'm going to pass it
off to some of my colleagues

483
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,740
who are also teaching
classes this spring, that you

484
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,940
may want to consider taking.

485
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,180
And again, that you
can jump right into--

486
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,990
great ways to explore different aspects
of computer science, or to know you

487
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,960
love this, and you want to
dive right into the major.

488
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,310
So the list here is the classes
in the spring that do not

489
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,755
have any prerequisites beyond CF50.

490
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:29,880
And we'll talk in just a
few minutes about each one

491
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,820
of those and also about 223, which would
be the logical thing to take after 201.

492
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,930
So two of these o35 and 078.

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,370
you should put your fingers in
your ears and go la la la la,

496
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,370
because the university will
not allow you to take them,

497
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,570
and there's nothing that
we can do about that.

498
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,278
But that doesn't make
them any less cool.

499
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,134
If you are a freshmen, pay attention
because you get one shot at this

500
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:01,050
and then hopefully you're no longer
a freshmen and you're out of luck.

501
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,030


502
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:12,600
We have 200 and 201, which
are some of our core sequence

503
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,470
and an entrepreneurship class
and a digital humanities class,

504
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,910
and then of course data structures
that is kind of, after that,

505
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,240
all of our upper level classes open up.

506
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,030
So we also have a bunch of majors.

507
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,280
And this is something that
you may or may not realize.

508
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,360
We are not just a peer
computer science major.

509
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,590
That's a great thing to do.

510
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,670
I did that.

511
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,230
I survived I enjoyed it.

512
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:45,720
But there's also ways to do a computer
science plus math or psychology

513
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,010
or engineering major,
electrical engineering, where

514
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,750
you take roughly the same number
of classes as a single major,

515
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,620
but you split them
between two disciplines.

516
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,550
And those ones are pretty
natural combinations,

517
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,987
but we also have a computing
in the arts major, which is

518
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,570
a little different than a joint major.

519
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,710
It's its own distinct major, which
means it has its own distinct director

520
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,660
of undergraduate studies.

521
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,320
But here you combine about six
classes in computer science

522
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,470
with about six classes in
one of the arts disciplines.

523
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,080
So that could be architecture or
fine arts or history of art or music

524
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,070
or theater, and these are all areas
where Yale is also really strong.

525
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,380
And its a great way to look at ways that
you can use computer science together

526
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,150
with other disciplines and also ways
that you can pursue multiple interests.

527
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,690
Students graduate out of this and go
on to get all sorts of jobs, including

528
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,060
all of the same jobs
that you typically think

529
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,310
of a computer science major getting.

530
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:52,590
But it opens the door to other things as
well and to exploring other interests.

531
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,180
So the computing in the arts major--
just a little bit more about it.

532
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,090
This is an interdepartmental major.

533
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:05,760
We've got these different groups set
up, where you take six computer science

534
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,210
courses, including the core, and
then you take about six classes

535
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,960
from one of the other
departments, and that way you

536
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,500
get the grounding in computer science
and the experience with that, and then

537
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,350
a discipline.

538
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,100
And then you start to think about
how you can apply them together.

539
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,960


540
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,880
So architecture of course
is building things,

541
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,630
and that's becoming very
computational using computer science

542
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,820
to develop new structures--

543
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,750
art as well.

544
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,390


545
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,640
Art history-- this is an area--

546
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,769
I work a lot with conservators
and archaeologists,

547
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:45,060
and I'll be talking about that.

548
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,850


549
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,030
And music-- and we'll have
Scott Peterson talk to you some

550
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,490
about computer music.

551
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,919
And theater, and again
these people go off

552
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,460
and work at all sorts of cool places.

553
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,912
You're not jeopardizing money.

554
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:03,870
You don't have to make
money you don't want to.

555
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,350
I did, after all go into academia.

556
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,410
But if you have further
questions, the person to contact

557
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,400
is Professor Dorsey, who is
unfortunately out of town today.

558
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,377
So she couldn't be here.

559
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,710
She will also be teaching one
of these freshmen seminars

560
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:26,700
in the spring on essentially 3D design.

561
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,520
In some sense, you don't
need a technical background.

562
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,980
But it is a somewhat technical course.

563
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,390
So you guys are well-prepared
for it, and you'll

564
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,190
be talking about 3D scanning, to
measure shapes of existing objects,

565
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,440
how to model on the computer new
shapes, how to modify 3-D models,

566
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,715
how to produce them using things like 3D
printing and milling and laser cutting.

567
00:26:52,715 --> 00:26:54,840
Some of those are things
we have in the department.

568
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,070
We have 3D printers.

569
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,890
In CEID, which you can
also sign up for, there's

570
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,100
a whole suite of these
tools for making things.

571
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,860


572
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,460
And, again, you don't need
any programming experience.

573
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,900
All of you have it.

574
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:15,660
You should have essentially high
school math, high school trigonometry,

575
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,090
and you have to be a
freshmen and you have

576
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,740
to pre-register through the freshman
seminar lottery for which, if you're

577
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,700
curious, you may also want
to talk to your college dean

578
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,290
and make sure that you
understand the process for that.

579
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,870
And then it goes into a lottery.

580
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,640
And if you're lucky, you get in.

581
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,930
So these classes are small.

582
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,120
They're limited.

583
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,860
The level of math that would
be involved in this class

584
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,800
would be, for example, when
you're doing 3D scanning,

585
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,600
you end up having two cameras, and
you know the way they're oriented

586
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,170
and you know, for instance, that
they maybe 10 centimeters apart.

587
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,530
So if both of them are seeing
the same point on an object,

588
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,659
that forms a triangle and you
want to know the distance from one

589
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:01,950
of your cameras to the objects.

590
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,680
So you can find out how far away it is.

591
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,810
And from that, you get shape.

592
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,680
And basically, you look at this and
you say, well, I know the angle alpha,

593
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,760
I know the angle beta, I know
this distance 10 centimeters.

594
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,280
I can apply the angle
side angle theorem to know

595
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,470
that I can calculate this point.

596
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,930
In particular, there is a law of
signs that you plug this formula in,

597
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,540
and you find out that if these two
points are 10 centimeters apart,

598
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:38,131
you're looking at something
that's 13.7 centimeters away.

599
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,880
So there's not going
to be more than that.

600
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,790
We're not talking about
advanced calculus.

601
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,630
We're not talking about knowing
all sorts of programming skills

602
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,570
or how 3D models actually work.

603
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,890
And it's going to be a combination
of lectures and labs and discussions.

604
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,770
Again, it will be a limited
size class as a seminar.

605
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,490
There will be some guest lectures.

606
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,320
You'll take a field trip to blue
sky that makes the Ice Age movies.

607
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,335
They're a big East
coast animation studio.

608
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:06,210
Again, if you have
questions about that, talk

609
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,510
to Professor Dorsi, who's teaching it.

610
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,930
And I definitely encourage you, if
you're a freshman, to check it out.

611
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,260
There's another one
that all of you can take

612
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,410
that I will be teaching which
is a course on applications

613
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,400
in the digital humanities.

614
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,149
And this is a brand new course.

615
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:26,940
And so it will adapt
a little bit depending

616
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,940
on exactly who is in the class and
how many of you are in the class.

617
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,720
I hope there's plenty.

618
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,910
And the idea is to talk
about different ways

619
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,850
to use computer science
in the humanities,

620
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,680
and then to work in groups on
projects, on different projects

621
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,390
in the digital humanities.

622
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,610
And so I'm having discussions
right now with faculty

623
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:53,170
all over campus about interesting
projects in their domain

624
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,580
so that we'll have a range
of ideas to start with.

625
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,460
But we'll do about half
the semester talking

626
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,460
both about application digital
humanities, but also about web

627
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,420
application development.

628
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,440
So these are sort of
continuing from pset 8--

629
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,370
how do you program in JavaScript,
how do you write Flask applications

630
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,180
and go a little more advanced
than we've done in CS50.

631
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:25,090
How do you write richer web applications
with richer client side interfaces?

632
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,620
And then how do you apply those?

633
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,790
It turns out there's all sorts
of applications in the humanities

634
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,620
where you want to
build databases and can

635
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:38,500
start to ask questions about your data
and look for connections between things

636
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,910
once you have the tools to assemble
all of that data and to visualize it.

637
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,680
And so there will be
different kinds of things.

638
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,770
Some of the ones that
I have lined up already

639
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:53,620
will be to detect the
meter in poetry and build

640
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,550
a database of meter and different
poems by different authors

641
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:03,850
and start to look at things like
is there a particular style of how

642
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,850
one poet may play with meter or
similarities between different poets

643
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:17,230
that you might be able to classify,
but also as a tool to do this detection

644
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,500
and help the process along
a good interface for it.

645
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,780
There is one with the Yale
Babylonian collection,

646
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,800
to build a really good database,
not just for saying let a search

647
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,890
a cylinder seal and see
a pretty picture of it

648
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,650
and see all of the
data we have about it,

649
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,010
but also see context, see
relationships to other cylinder seals,

650
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,190
be able to say, ah, this one
has a carving of a stag on it.

651
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,520
Let me find the other ones that
have carvings of stags on them

652
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,047
and try and find relationships
and connections between them

653
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:50,380
that can be useful for research.

654
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,900


655
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,830
Another interesting one that
I learned about yesterday is

656
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,531
potentially to curator essentially
the public art on campus--

657
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,280
so all of the stone
carvings on buildings,

658
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,440
all of the paintings
hanging in buildings,

659
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,050
and understand what we
have on campus, what

660
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,730
we know about the provenance and
history and state of preservation,

661
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,290
what things we should really take down.

662
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,680
And then how do we present
those and contextualize them?

663
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,390
So I took this picture yesterday.

664
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,240
You may have seen a similar
picture in the newspaper.

665
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,080
This is a carving that was on
the outside of Sterling Library

666
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,690
right near the entrance to the CTL.

667
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,660
And somebody noticed I
think last summer that there

668
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,070
was this carving on a back entrance
of a pilgrim shooting an Indian.

669
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,730
And you stop and scratch
your head and say,

670
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,700
there's nobody that really thinks
that's in good taste any longer.

671
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,960
And so maybe we should
not put it somewhere

672
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,900
that is now becoming a prominent
entrance to the library.

673
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,920
So it's sitting on West Campus in
the conservation lab at the moment.

674
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,350
But these are sorts of questions that
you might be looking into and asking.

675
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,580
Working with me on ways
to look at potential

676
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,573
matches between fragments
of ancient wall paintings.

677
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,260


678
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,590
These are fragments of wall
paintings from Roman times,

679
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,960
from about 2000 years ago for example.

680
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,360
So a range of different sorts
of projects, some with music,

681
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,350
and that's what--

682
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,409
I'm hoping to then bring in
some computer scientists,

683
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,200
some people interested
in computer science,

684
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,075
some are interested in
computer and the arts,

685
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,780
some interested really in just in
the applications to their domains

686
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,580
to get a dynamic atmosphere where
you're learning from each other

687
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,460
and about the kinds of
questions you can ask.

688
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,770
And again, if you have
any questions, you

689
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,790
can always feel free
to email me about them.

690
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,160


691
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,170
And then I want to move on.

692
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,050
Scott is another lecturer in
the computer science department

693
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,910
and specializes in computer music.

694
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,960
SCOTT: Awesome, hello.

695
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,930
I'm Scott Peterson.

696
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,290
I'm a lecturer in computer science.

697
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,500
I joined the department
last year after serving

698
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,969
a number of years in
the music department,

699
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,690
doing sort of various
technological things.

700
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:17,110
I teach four classes, CPSC 035,
which I'll talk about at some length

701
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,770
in a little bit, 134, 431, 432.

702
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,690
And I'm also the director of the
Yale Open Music initiative, which

703
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,520
I don't know if you've heard about.

704
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,670
But I'll also talked
about in just a bit.

705
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,850
Before I do that, I'll talk very
briefly about classes that you probably

706
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,138
can't take yet, although maybe.

707
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:40,699
And those are 431 and 432.

708
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:45,409
They are algorithmic and heuristic
composition, and sound synthesis

709
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,639
respectively.

710
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,060
And they have prerequisites,
which are 202 and 223, I think.

711
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,190
And essentially, they
are together a sort

712
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:04,640
of complete look at computer
assisted music composition and sound

713
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,760
synthesis together-- so
using a high level language,

714
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,990
and we use supercollider
for all of these classes,

715
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:16,279
looking at ways that the machine can
help us both organize notes, think

716
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:18,320
about music in different
ways, and then also sort

717
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,790
of delve into how sound is
constructed from the very lowest

718
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,140
level of digital representations
inside the machine.

719
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,520
Before I talk about 35 and
134, I'll talk very briefly

720
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,330
about the Yale Open Music initiative.

721
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,870
So this is not a class.

722
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:41,490
This is just something that you can
join or attend workshops that we give.

723
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,190
So this is a sort of loose group of
people who are interested in everything

724
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,890
at the intersection of
music and technology.

725
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:54,110
So this might mean computer
music programming outside

726
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,030
of the sort of classroom setting.

727
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,920
It could mean putting
together machines that

728
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,120
have arrays of sensors that
then send sensor data back

729
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,890
to a laptop that asks it
for said data and then does

730
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,610
some sort of sonification with it.

731
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,350
And it's generally informal.

732
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,960
We've been the recipient
of a couple seed grants

733
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,490
that have allowed us to buy some cool
stuff, our arduinos and Raspberry Pis

734
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,890
and put some of these machines together.

735
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:30,770
And we've given at least one of
these workshops in conjunction

736
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,040
with the new center for
collaborative arts and media,

737
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,170
which is another place
that you should check out

738
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:41,540
if your interests sort of intersect
computer technology and anything

739
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,850
sort of artistic.

740
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,660
So 134 also has no prerequisites.

741
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,250
It uses the same high level
language, which is supercollider,

742
00:36:52,250 --> 00:37:01,520
to investigate how the machine can
help us compose music, also sound

743
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,600
synthesis, and also interaction.

744
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:10,040
So this is a quick shot from the
music studio in computer science

745
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,930
where students of 134 were just
working with arduinos and sensor arrays

746
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:20,630
to input incoming sensor data
into laptops and supercollider

747
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,960
and then sonify that data and some
sort of hopefully meaningful way.

748
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,490
The enrollment is generally
small for these classes.

749
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,100
So if you like small classes and
a lot of time that sort of seminar

750
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,640
feel that you might not get
in a class of this size,

751
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,890
then this class may be for you.

752
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,590
And this is offered in the fall.

753
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,310
So the next course is CPSC 025.

754
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,370
So this is a freshmen seminar.

755
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,220
This is where you plug yours
if you're not a freshmen.

756
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,820
And this class is divided
into generally three parts.

757
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,090
The first part is music production.

758
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,010
And so we spend a lot of time talking
about how we can capture sound

759
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,600
in the real world, represent that
sound in the machine and software,

760
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,540
and then investigating digital audio
workstations for sound production,

761
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,980
processing, etc.

762
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,640
The second part of the class is
programming and supercollider,

763
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,250
again-- so sort of all the
stuff that I talked about.

764
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,320
It's a gentle introduction.

765
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,070
It doesn't assume that you have any
programming, but obviously you do.

766
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,700
And then the third part--

767
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,400
sort of my favorite part--
is this intersection

768
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
of the real world and the machine.

769
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
This is physical computing
and sensors, and this

770
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,870
is where the wheel meets the road.

771
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:55,470
And we have a lot of projects that
work with real world sensor data, that

772
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:01,950
work with human movement, that can sense
ambient light, that can sense motion.

773
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:06,990
And then we talk about some of
the issues of converting that

774
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:11,020
into meaningful musical information.

775
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,560
So if you have any questions about--

776
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,720
pardon me-- any questions about any
of these or the Open Music initiative

777
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,130
or you want a a tour of the music
studio in computer science, please

778
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,920
feel free to email me.

779
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,995
Thanks so much.

780
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:29,470
[APPLAUSE]

781
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:39,369


782
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:42,410
KYLE JENSEN: Hi, I teach a class that
helps you use your computer science

783
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,780
knowledge from CS50 to build startups.

784
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,890
That could be nonprofits.

785
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,900
That could be some scalable software
startup like Facebook or Snapchat.

786
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,650
The class is computer science 213.

787
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,960
It's also management 659.

788
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,190
My name is Kyle Jensen.

789
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,410
I'm Associate Dean at the
Yale School of Management.

790
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,360
And this is one of my favorite classes.

791
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,900
The class is essentially 50% web
application development, full stack,

792
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,320
and 50% class that you might find
at the business school teaching

793
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,360
an introduction to entrepreneurship.

794
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,640
Fundamentally, the
class helps you identify

795
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,260
customers, people whose lives
you can change in some fashion,

796
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,370
to verify to yourself that those
people have some problem that you think

797
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,860
they have, to build a
business around that,

798
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,340
and the technology skills
you need in order to do that.

799
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,070
I think you should take the class.

800
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,210
It's fantastic.

801
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,460
Again, my name is Kyle Jensen.

802
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,590
You can easily find me on the interwebs.

803
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,848
Thank you.

804
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,782
[APPLAUSE]

805
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:52,444


806
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,110
STEPHEN SLADE: So I think I have slides.

807
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,200
Let's see if this works.

808
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,010
Yeah, look at that.

809
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,940
OK, I'm Stephen Slade.

810
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,990
And I teach both CS200 and 201.

811
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,815
And who am I?

812
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:05,990
I am a hybrid.

813
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,000
I am both theory and practice.

814
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,350
So I was a Yale undergraduate.

815
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,680
I majored in music, and
I study computer science.

816
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,210
I came back here to graduate school.

817
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,340
I got a master's in PhD
in computer science.

818
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,370
In the meantime, I worked
in presidential campaigns

819
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,690
at the White House designing computer
systems, management information

820
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,440
systems.

821
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,520
I also taught in the
business school at NYU.

822
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,640
And from there, I
migrated to Wall Street.

823
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,280
I worked in finance and risk
management for many years.

824
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,880
So I've looked the world
from both sides now,

825
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,810
from both the practical
and the theoretical.

826
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,690
And in theory, there's no difference
between theory and practice.

827
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,399
But in practice, there is.

828
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:51,440
I've written three books.

829
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,040
They were all dedicated to
Yale alumni, namely my family.

830
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,350
So my wife went to Yale.

831
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,960
My three children went to Yale.

832
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,300
I have two daughters who
majored in computer science,

833
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,770
and they both work at Google.

834
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:10,190
I'm a big believer in educating
women to be computer scientists.

835
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:16,850
And when they were growing up, I viewed
my job as not teaching them to read,

836
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,250
but teaching them to love to read.

837
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,590
I didn't view my job as
teaching them to play the piano,

838
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,530
but teaching them to
love to play the piano.

839
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:31,640
And I view my job here in CS200 and 201
as not teaching you computer science,

840
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,560
but teaching you to
love computer science.

841
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,270
And I think that's what
David tries to do as well.

842
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,450
That's my impression.

843
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,990
Anyway, so there are two courses--

844
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,150
200 and 201.

845
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,740
And they're sort of sister
courses, sibling courses.

846
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,420
They're meant to be theory and practice.

847
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,130
So 200 is more practice,
201 is more theory.

848
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,710
But they have the Common Core in that
they both satisfy the prerequisites

849
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,740
for a future in computer science.

850
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:06,200
And in particular, if you take either
course, you will learn recursion.

851
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,170
And see what happens when
you Google recursion.

852
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,660
And it's an interesting exercise.

853
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,360
You will learn Unix.

854
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,645
You will learn computer
architecture, machine language.

855
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:20,300
There are programming assignments
about every week or so,

856
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,760
much like you had in CS50.

857
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,360
And in addition, I introduce
what I call logical problems.

858
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,420
And the idea is to make you
realize that you make assumptions

859
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,270
about the world that often are false.

860
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,550
And this is the bane of
the computer programmer,

861
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,500
that when you're writing
a computer program,

862
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,590
you make assumptions about the
input or the behavior of the user,

863
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,330
and often those assumptions are false.

864
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,100
So what I try to do is train
you to think out of the box,

865
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:51,260
to think in terms larger than
what your normal assumptions are.

866
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,710
So for example, here's this a
representative logical problem.

867
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,020
What is the next number in
the following sequence--

868
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:04,040
1969, 73, 77, 81, 85, 91, 93, 99.

869
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,990
What's the next number?

870
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,884
Anyone know?

871
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:09,050
All right, let's analyze it.

872
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,540
First of all, they're all years.

873
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,330


874
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,910
All right, they're all odd years.

875
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,820
Am

876
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:26,090
OK, the current year is
2017, which is an odd year.

877
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:32,482
So that's a plausible
answer to the question.

878
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,940
So anyone want to guess what
the answer to the question is?

879
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,490


880
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:43,980
OK, good because no one will know the
answer until at least this weekend,

881
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,210
and maybe not even then.

882
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,186


883
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,670
[INAUDIBLE]

884
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,860
That's almost right.

885
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,020
So 1999 was the last time Yale
beat Harvard in New Haven.

886
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,820


887
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,580
So maybe this Saturday we'll
know the answer to the question.

888
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,550
We'll see.

889
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,660
It's supposed to rain, I think.

890
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,390
Anyway.

891
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:16,140
OK, 201, 201 is a prerequisite
for the rest of the major,

892
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,480
and it's meant to teach you theory.

893
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,540
So it teaches you recursion,
Unix, machine language, computer

894
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,700
architecture.

895
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,710
The programming language
you used is Racket,

896
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,800
which is a dialect of Scheme and LISP.

897
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,140
These were languages that were
developed maybe 50 years ago,

898
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,330
and they've evolved primarily at MIT.

899
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,420
But they've been used for artificial
intelligence for many years.

900
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,870
Putting Racket on your resume is
not going to get you anywhere.

901
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,520
It's going to get you odd questions.

902
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,740
So that's not the point.

903
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,395
We will learn Turing
machines, Boolean logic.

904
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:59,730
You'll see how to design software that
emulates digital gates and circuits.

905
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:05,340
You'll write machine language for
a fictional machine, the TC201.

906
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,010
We will look at formal
languages, regular expressions,

907
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,750
deterministic finite automata.

908
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,130
We'll look at computational
complexity and analysis of algorithms.

909
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,770
I think you did a little
bit of that in CS50.

910
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,980
I have a link here to the
syllabus for the current semester

911
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,200
in case you want to look.

912
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,200
And CS201 satisfies the de
jure requirement for the major

913
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,900
and for courses like 223.

914
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,960
200 is meant to be the
practical alternative to 201.

915
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,500
And as I say at the bottom, it
satisfies the de facto requirements

916
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,400
for the higher level courses.

917
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,080
So for example, you learn enough about
computer science and programming,

918
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,030
recursion, Unix, machine language
to take the higher level courses,

919
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,530
but sometimes you may need the
permission of the instructor.

920
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,230
But in general, it hasn't been an issue.

921
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,690
If you're not a computer
science major and you merely

922
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,750
want to take a course that will
help you in other areas of life,

923
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,270
this is probably a
reasonable course to take.

924
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,620
In particular, the
programming language we use

925
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,960
is Python, which you
should put on your resume--

926
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,550
Python.

927
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,210
And we will look at Python in much
more detail than you had in CS50,

928
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,560
but the fact that you've had it
already is probably beneficial.

929
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,030
So we will do object oriented
programming in Python,

930
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,630
which is like object oriented
programming in C and C++.

931
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,420
We'll look at software
engineering issues.

932
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,290
We will look at databases-- and not
only how to use a database like SQL,

933
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,790
but actually how to build a database
system in an object oriented way.

934
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,490
We'll use Python to build
an object oriented database.

935
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,130


936
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,110
We will do machine language but not
on a theoretical machine, the TC201.

937
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:59,740
We'll see how to interpret machine
language that's generated by Python.

938
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,170
So Python generates
what's called byte code,

939
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,120
and you will write a byte code
interpreter for Python in the course.

940
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,640
We'll also look at practical
real world problems,

941
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,970
not Turing machines,
not Boolean expressions.

942
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:17,830
But we will look at cryptography
and information security.

943
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:22,930
We will look at machine learning,
which is also sort of generally known--

944
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:26,350
it covers things like big
data and data science.

945
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,850
And we'll look at applications.

946
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,810
So some practical applications
of machine learning

947
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:36,790
include driverless cars and
actually information security.

948
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:43,270
So these days, one interesting
application of machine learning

949
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,590
is using machine learning
to break encryption codes,

950
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,050
or to create encryption codes.

951
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,852
And again, I have the address of
the syllabus from last spring.

952
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:58,810
It'll be a little bit different this
year based on what I've said here.

953
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,600


954
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,540
And I think that's it.

955
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,420
[APPLAUSE]

956
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,390


957
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:13,580
I'll be around if people have questions.

958
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,270
JIM: So, yes, so I'm Jim [INAUDIBLE].

959
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,300
I'm the DUS for computer science.

960
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,300
And I also teach computer
science 223, or at least will

961
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,420
be teaching computer
science 223 in the spring.

962
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,560
So what I was asked to come here and
talk about was both of these-- first,

963
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,410
I'm going to talk about
computer science 223

964
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:33,560
and why you might want
to or not take that class

965
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,410
or not take that class at
some point in the future

966
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,080
and what's involved in doing that.

967
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,913
And then I'm going to
talk a little bit more

968
00:49:39,913 --> 00:49:42,170
broadly about the
computer science major,

969
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,900
if that's something that some of
you might be considering or some

970
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,358
of the other options related
to that, like our joint majors

971
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,880
or, in some cases, the
possibility of double majoring.

972
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,407
I did not actually bring any slides.

973
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,990
So I'm just going to stand here
and wave my arms around a bit.

974
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,150
Maybe I'll actually stand up.

975
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,700
And I suppose if we have
anything that we need to draw,

976
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,660
we do have the blackboard here.

977
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,800
So let me start by talking about 223.

978
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,066
223 is usually the second
programming oriented course

979
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:10,940
that people take as part of the
computer science major, the first one

980
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,130
being computer science 201.

981
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,560
If you are thinking of being
a computer science major,

982
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,890
you should probably
go through 201 first.

983
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,900
201 is formally a prerequisite for 223,
but as with all prerequisites at Yale,

984
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,120
this is an open negotiating position.

985
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,460
And with permission
of the instructor, you

986
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,760
can take 223 without
previously taking 201.

987
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,330
That being said, historically
students who have come in to 223

988
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,360
without taking 201 have
generally not done as well in 223

989
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,410
and then 323 after that as people
who go through the normal track.

990
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,270
If you are doing the
computer science major,

991
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:49,160
we do not necessarily require you to
take 201 if you've already done 223.

992
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,220
But we do ask you to do an extra
elective to make up for it.

993
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,865
In terms of the actual content
of the class, the title the class

994
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:57,914
is data structures and
programming techniques.

995
00:50:57,914 --> 00:50:59,330
And that's mostly what it's about.

996
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,370
We talk about programming
from the point of view

997
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,600
of how do you organize your code, the
programming techniques side on the one

998
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,820
part, and how do you
organize your data that's

999
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,980
operating on the data structure side.

1000
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,660
The thing that people often find odd
running into it, which was probably

1001
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,050
not going to be so much an issue for
you guys having come through CS50,

1002
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,681
is the language of instruction
is C. So for people

1003
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:23,180
coming into the program who are
used to languages like Java,

1004
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,346
this can be a little bit
of a shock, given that C is

1005
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:28,070
such a terrible programming language.

1006
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,650
We do you C for a reason,
which is that we're

1007
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,940
trying to get you an understanding of
computers down at a fairly low level,

1008
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,940
at the point of individual bits getting
shoved around, maybe not so much

1009
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,150
in 223, but certainly by
the time you get to 323.

1010
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,840
And C is about as close as we can
get to actual assembly language

1011
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,590
and still have it be something
that's usable by any human beings

1012
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,090
at this point pretty much.

1013
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,860
And so that's why we
use that in 223 323.

1014
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,890
If you want to come take 223, you
should feel free to check it out.

1015
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,220
And then like I said, I'll
be teaching it this spring.

1016
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,860
We offer it generally
every semester now.

1017
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,962
So if you don't want
to take it immediately,

1018
00:52:05,962 --> 00:52:07,670
if you want to consider
looking into 201,

1019
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,870
which we also offer every semester,
you can go do that first and then

1020
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,990
and then come back.

1021
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,300
It's really up to you.

1022
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,090
Any questions about 223?

1023
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,930
All right, so now I'd like to
move on to topic two, which

1024
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,970
is the computer science major.

1025
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,420
Which I don't know how many of you might
be thinking about the computer science

1026
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,350
major.

1027
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,472
But so I'm the DUS for
computer science, which

1028
00:52:29,472 --> 00:52:32,180
means that I'm responsible for
administering the computer science

1029
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,679
majors.

1030
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,970
Since it's a very large
major, we actually

1031
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:38,460
have two other people who do
advising within the major.

1032
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,450
We have a sophomore class advisor
who is currently a professor,

1033
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,870
[? Rezeech ?] [? Pizscoch, ?]
and a junior class advisor,

1034
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,300
who is currently Yang Yang, although
he'll be replaced by [? Brent ?]

1035
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,670
[? Schuzuleti ?] next semester
because he's going to be on leave.

1036
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,370
I handle all the seniors
and freshmen and also handle

1037
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,580
issues that come up that are a little
bit more involved in terms of dealings

1038
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,770
with the major.

1039
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,320
The major itself is a fairly
straightforward major.

1040
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,590
We have five core classes,
201 and 223, which

1041
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,260
I mentioned already, 201
being the introduction to kind

1042
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,240
of all of computer science
intended to give you

1043
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,100
an idea of what you're getting into.

1044
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,940
And then 223 is the
first of two programming

1045
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,230
oriented classes on the kind
of a track of 223 and 323,

1046
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,700
which are basically what
I mentioned already.

1047
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,700
And then 323 is more of
a systems programming

1048
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,350
class and computer
organization class aimed

1049
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,220
at giving you an idea of how
things work at a fairly low level

1050
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,360
and how hardware works and so forth.

1051
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,490
We also have a sort of math
theory track on the other side.

1052
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,520
And we now have basically
two versions of that.

1053
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,310
The standard version of that
is computer science 202,

1054
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,990
mathematical tools for computer science
and computer science 365 algorithms.

1055
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,250
The purpose of 202 is to take
people who don't necessarily

1056
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,350
have much background in
mathematics and give you

1057
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,910
what is often called mathematical
maturity, an idea of how proofs work

1058
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,820
and how definitions work and
how things in mathematics works,

1059
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,180
and kind of cover a little bit
about the various different areas

1060
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,367
within mathematics that are
relevant to computer science, mostly

1061
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:10,200
in order to get you up
to speed so that when

1062
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,630
you hit 365, the algorithms class--

1063
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,710
which is a class about
reasoning, about things

1064
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,850
you would be implementing in programs
without actually implementing them--

1065
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,300
you will have the mathematical tools
to actually be able to do that.

1066
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,570
And having gone through the core
classes, these five classes,

1067
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:29,310
we then ask you to go and do
six electives on top of that

1068
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,229
for the bachelor of science degree
plus your senior project, four

1069
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:34,020
electives plus the
senior project if you're

1070
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,760
doing the Bachelor of Arts degree.

1071
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,620
And these advanced
electives will typically

1072
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,840
be 400 level classes
in computer science.

1073
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,360
These vary in terms of what
prerequisites they have.

1074
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,240
You can actually start taking
electives pretty much once you

1075
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,260
get through to 223, and there even
one or two that do not have anything

1076
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,755
beyond 201 as a prerequisite.

1077
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,880
And of course, as you take more and
more of the core classes, more of those

1078
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,440
will open up.

1079
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,420
So the typical schedule-- people
will start by going and doing

1080
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,250
201, 202, 223, and so forth.

1081
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,030
And as the electives
become available, you'll

1082
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,610
start filling them until the point
where you get to maybe your senior year,

1083
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:09,930
you will be mostly taking electives
and doing your senior project.

1084
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,170
The other track I should
mention for the theory side

1085
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,390
is that if you were really
gung ho about mathematics

1086
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,310
and the theory end of
computer science, you

1087
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:20,060
have the option of, instead of
taking computer science 202,

1088
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:24,310
you can take the discrete math course
over in mathematics, mathematics 244.

1089
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,790
And if you do that, that
opens up the intensive version

1090
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,510
of the algorithms class, computer
science 366, which is basically

1091
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,660
a more advanced version of
our standard algorithms class,

1092
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,290
which some people might like to take.

1093
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,240
So any questions about the basic
major or anything like that?

1094
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,910


1095
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,310
We also offer several joint majors.

1096
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:49,360
There is a joint major with mathematics,
computer science, and mathematics,

1097
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,699
a joint major with psychology.

1098
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:53,990
We also have a joint major
with electrical engineering,

1099
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,020
electrical engineering
and computer science.

1100
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,450
These all have more or
less the same structure.

1101
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,260
You have to take essentially
the core classes in both majors.

1102
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,240
But then when you get up
to the elective level,

1103
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,935
instead of making you take a full
set of electives from both sides,

1104
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,060
you generally have an
abbreviated list of electives

1105
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,040
that you're expected to
take from either side,

1106
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,590
typically working out to
about 14 or 15 credits

1107
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,510
total by the time you
complete the major.

1108
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:21,100
And you do a single senior project
that is acceptable to both majors.

1109
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,296
Some people will also do double
majors by taking advantage of the fact

1110
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:26,920
that the computer science major,
particularly if you do the BA,

1111
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,219
is a fairly thin major.

1112
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,010
So we get a lot of
people who will do, say,

1113
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,130
a BA in computer science, which
is 10 credits, and then a major

1114
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,420
in some other area.

1115
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,502
And these can vary for departments
all the way across Yale.

1116
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:41,710
If you can arrange for something that
has overlap with computer science, that

1117
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,450
has courses in common
or the courses that

1118
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,795
could be counted as
electives to both majors,

1119
00:56:45,795 --> 00:56:47,920
this can also be efficient
because you can actually

1120
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,410
get down to as little
as eight extra electives

1121
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,720
to add on a computer science
major because we allow up

1122
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,560
to two courses of overlap.

1123
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,310
I personally don't necessarily
recommend doing a double major just

1124
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,750
for the sake of doing a double major.

1125
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,580
But if you're taking a lot
of these classes anyway,

1126
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,810
this might be something
that you can look into.

1127
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,654


1128
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:06,820
I think that's basically it.

1129
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:14,457


1130
00:57:14,457 --> 00:57:15,540
SPEAKER 1: Thanks so much.

1131
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,010
All right, so we are
officially adjourned.

1132
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,926
Please join us and the
staff in back for cake.

1133
00:57:18,926 --> 00:57:21,570
And we'll see you at
the hackathon and fair.

1134
00:57:21,570 --> 00:00:00,000
