26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,270
And it is of course, this weekend,
Harvard-Yale, and in full disclosure,

27
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,900
we actually spent yesterday at Yale
wrapping up the course there as well,

28
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,610
but we did think this was perhaps an
opportunity to make a few changes here

But we thought we'd use
this as an opportunity

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,250
to take a closer look at this problem
that was solved by some of our friends

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,050
in New Haven just a few years ago
in honor of this weekend's event.

DAVID AULICINO: We're
headed up to Boston,

37
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,650
checking out the stadium for the prank.

38
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,130
A few years ago, I was
at a math conference,

39
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,930
and I was sitting around the table at
dinner with a few other mathematicians.

40
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,470
And one of them went
to Harvard and started

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,630
telling the story of this amazing
prank that was against Harvard.

42
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,760
And at that point, I
felt I had to interrupt,

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,970
and said well, actually I can
tell you a lot more about that.

44
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,470

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,910
SPEAKER 1: The idea was
perfected in a dorm room.

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,660
MIKE KAI: Came up with
the idea, actually,

48
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,860
to prank them with signs
at the football game.

49
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,420
We threw some ideas out there as
far as what the signs would say.

50
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,322
We eventually settled on "We Suck."

51
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:24,280
DAVID AULICINO: And my immediate
reaction was no, this will never work.

52
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,910
, However, the problem solver
in me started thinking, well,

53
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,920
maybe we can make this work.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
SPEAKER 1: The problem?

55
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,550
They had to infiltrate Harvard
stadium without getting caught,

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,230
sneak in 1,800 placards, distribute
them to unsuspecting Harvard fans,

57
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,682
and then convince those
fans to prank themselves.

every possible thing

come up with a solution for it.

put two reds on top of it.

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,626
Level seven.

181
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,472

Making them sweat that's
what I'm giving them now

183
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:20,664
They know they're
talking about the Hammer

184
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,538
DAVID MALAN: That's level eight.

00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:25,526
MUSIC: Singers are sweating,
so pass them a wipe or tape

186

To learn what's it gonna take
in the 90's to burn the charts

187
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:29,510
DAVID MALAN: Oh!

188
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,032

or you might as well quit

189
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:37,815

DAVID MALAN: Yes.

193
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,250

196
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,460
DAVID MALAN: Death at five.

197
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,870
MUSIC: It is said if you can't groove
to this then you probably are dead

198
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,905
DAVID MALAN: That's OK.

through your hair

This is it

201
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,400
For a winner

202
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,140
DAVID MALAN: One level
to go after this, yes.

Yeah, can't touch this

206
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,583

DAVID MALAN: On level nine.

214
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:34,590
I didn't do better.

215
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,230


216
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,120
Okay, nice.

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,890
Yes, oh!

218
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,198
Oh, don't give up yet!

00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:48,687

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,900
Let's give it another
one or two more deaths?

224
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,590

Come on, Diana, come on, yeah!

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,040
One more, one more.

Every time you see me

The Hammer's just so hype

233
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,022
I'm dope on the floor

I've toured around the world

00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,907

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,060
DAVID MALAN: What's that?

244
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,742
I think you just-- luck.

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,360
DAVID MALAN: One more life?

247
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,600
Two more lives?

248
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,568
MUSIC: You can't touch this

249
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,044
Yeah

250
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,504
Can't touch this

251
00:11:57,504 --> 00:12:00,470
I told you, can't touch this

252
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,870
DAVID MALAN: Yes, oh!

253
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,841
One more, one more, one more.

254
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:05,783

255
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:09,080
Can't touch this

256
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,300
DAVID MALAN: Yes!

257
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,345
Yes!

258
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,564
All right a big round
of applause for Diana.

259
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:16,750
Congrats.

260
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,330
Thank you.

261
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,630
All right, so we will post the
link on the course's web site

262
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,910
if you would like to try
your hand at that as well.

263
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,810
Before we forge ahead though, a
big thanks to CS50 50's whole team.

264
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,360
Suffice it to say, with
office hours and sections

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,540
and the problem sets and, soon,
the CS50 hackathon and fair,

266
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,700
we truly could not do
it without all of these

267
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,643
faces here, all of the faces behind
you today, and the whole team online.

268
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,976
So if we could, a big round
of applause for CS50's team.

269
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:45,240


270
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,210
Allow me to call out a
few folks in particular.

271
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,250
One, these are all of the names of
CS50 50 staff, both here and afar,

272
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,950
helping to make this course possible.

273
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,630
CS50 50's production team, of
course, making it possible for you

274
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,200
to tune in across campus
or across the world,

275
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,114
and then, some folks too that might
be more familiar over the course

276
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:03,780
of the semester.

277
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,590
CS50'S 50's own Doug Lloyd, who not
only has been the longest-serving staff

278
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,870
member for the past 11 years now, he was
also here on Jeopardy some years ago,

279
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,730
and won.

280
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,160
So that was amazing to watch on TV.

281
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,304
CS50's own Rob Bowden,
or that guy in Thayer

282
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:22,470
from whom you might have
gotten some help over time,

283
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,940
since he is a proctor there.

284
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,280
And of course, perhaps
the most familiar face

285
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,990
of all, CS50's own Zamaila
from the problem sets.

286
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,160


287
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,430
And then of course, today's
performer, playing out, if you will,

288
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,160
problem set three for us, Brian.

289
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,320
A big thanks to him as well.

290
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,020
And then a special final thanks
to someone particularly special.

291
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,580
CS50's own Maria, who has been with the
course now in some way for four years.

292
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,880
Sadly but excitingly, Maria is about
to go off into the real world, working

293
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,930
as an engineer at Facebook,
but she actually took CS50 here

294
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,110
as a first year years ago, and
then is among the longest-serving

295
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,950
members of the course's head's
team in that she's been with us now

296
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,927
in some form for the past three years.

297
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:08,760
And in fact we went
through some old footage

298
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,830
and, in fairness, one
of her friends actually

299
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,130
found this, an old video from
her freshman year years ago.

300
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,100
This was Maria like, right here,
volunteering some years ago.

301
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,610
So if we enhance this here, a big
round of applause especially for Maria.

302
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,520


303
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,430
She will be missed,
as of course will you.

304
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,610
This is week 11, and so this is
where we promised we would get to.

305
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,550
And indeed, especially on the
heels of a little quiz that you

306
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,410
might have taken or finished
yesterday on what is ultimately,

307
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,750
what does ultimately
matter in this course

308
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,249
is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates,

309
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,720
but where you end up relative
to yourself today and next week

310
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
and beyond, relative to
where you were in week zero.

311
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,130
So we do hope that you have gotten
an extraordinary amount of time

312
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,280
back now from this class,
but also a huge return

313
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,530
just in terms of the concepts
and the practical skills

314
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,020
we hope you can now bring to
your future studies in CS,

315
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,730
or if you exit CS at this
point to your own domains

316
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,660
and can solve problems
all the more effectively.

317
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,250
And in fact, if you're curious
as to how some of your classmates

318
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,220
have labeled themselves over
time, this is where, in week zero,

319
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,280
you all were with the
majority of the class

320
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,030
describing themselves
as less comfortable.

321
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,490
And if you're still feeling
a little bit that way,

322
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,601
rest assured some 12 weeks later, none
of you are among those less comfortable

323
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,100
anymore.

324
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,690
Everyone has been upgraded
as of today to somewhere

325
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,280
in between or more comfortable.

326
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,950
So do realize, that too
has been a stepping stone.

327
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,510
And in fact now, even if you
are currently a first year,

328
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,560
or we've had high school students in
the past or a junior and a rising senior

329
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,770
realize that the opportunities ahead,
not only to study other courses in CS,

330
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,460
but to teach computer science,
TF-ing or CA-ing for CS50.

331
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,554
Hands down, the most effective way
to learn this kind of material,

332
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,470
and perhaps any other
is to actually teach it,

333
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,580
and that's certainly true for me and
for Maria and Brian and Zamaila and Doug

334
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,430
and Rob, and the whole
of CS50's team here.

335
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,010
I mean in fact, some of them
with CS50's production team

336
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,770
wanted to share with you
an invitation to join us

337
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,280
in some form on campus this
coming fall 2018 online.

338
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,630
In the meantime, we're in
any number of other ways.

339
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,540
If we could dim the lights for
this invitation from the staff.

340
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,607
ALAISHA: I'm Alaisha.

341
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:17,690

342
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,650

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,691
ALAISHA: I'm a sophomore.

344
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:20,580
THOMAS: I'm a senior.

345
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,720
BRIAN: I'm a junior studying
computer science and linguistics.

346
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,280
ALAISHA: I'm concentrating on CSO.

347
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,450
ALLISON: CS50 is also just
because it's changed my life.

348
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,800
It made me a computer
science concentrator.

349
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,137
ALAISHA: I am a TF for CS50.

350
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:33,220
ALLISON: Course assistant.

351
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,970
ATHENA: This is my
second year TF-ing now.

352
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,180
THOMAS: This is my third year
being a teaching fellow for CS50.

353
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,080
ATHENA: Becoming part of CS50
staff helped empower me so much.

354
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,334
ALAISHA: I was a total beginner, never
anticipated programming beyond CS50,

355
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,940
but here I am.

356
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,880
It was just something I
never thought I would do.

357
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,420
I think it's just been really
exciting going from being a beginner

358
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,050
to being comfortable
enough to TF this class.

359
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,120
MARIA: Everything that
has come out of this

360
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,655
has helped me grow so much
as a teacher, as a student.

361
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,780
DANIEL: Also, the culture
and the environment of it

362
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,079
is also pretty unique.

363
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,960
ALLISON: Definitely found a community
of friends within the CS50 staff.

364
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,659
ATHENA: Be prepared to have
students who look up to you

365
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,700
and really appreciate the
work that you're doing,

366
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,460
and just realize that you're
not just a teaching fellow.

367
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,490
You're not just this person
behind the whiteboard.

368
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,880
You're a student who took
this too, and can really

369
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,300
level with other people in your
section and figure out what's going on,

370
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,930
and make it a good experience for them.

371
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,450
DANIEL: I decided that I can
get the best of both worlds.

372
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,199
I can get to teach
about computer science,

373
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,890
and those are two of my passions.

374
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,090
THOMAS: I just really love teaching
computer science to beginners.

375
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,330
CS50 is where all that
beginner energy is,

376
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,510
and that's where I can make a real
impact on the students careers in CS.

377
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,860
BRIAN: It's amazing to see how much
this course can do in just a semester,

378
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,880
and how from September until
December, students learn so much

379
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,029
and gain so much
experience and knowledge.

380
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,320
And watching that and working
with them in that process

381
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,000
has always been really,
really inspiring.

382
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,708
MARIA: It's been so,
so wonderful getting

383
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,290
to see these people grow
just like I did myself.

384
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,800
THOMAS: One of the most
rewarding things I've done here.

385
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,070
That's why I keep coming back.

386
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,100
DANIEL: Going to office
hours and helping people out,

387
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,001
it makes you feel good, and it makes
other people feel good as well.

388
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,000
BRIAN: My name is Brian.

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,020
THOMAS: I'm Thomas Lively.

390
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,894
ALLISON: I'm Allison.

391
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:25,940
MARIA: I'm Maria, and this is CS50.

392
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,216
DAVID MALAN: So in the coming weeks,
please do feel welcome and encouraged.

393
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:32,090
Even if you were among those less
comfortable and still kind of think

394
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,460
you are, that is
undoubtedly not the case,

395
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,880
because amongst CS50 staff are students
who have just taken the course a year

396
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,124
or two or more prior, you
potentially among them.

397
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:43,790
And in fact there's other
opportunities to get involved as well.

398
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,998
In addition to the on-campus
class here, we of course

399
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:50,600
have our friends in New Haven,
but even beyond, the CS50's team

400
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,530
work with communities around the world.

401
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,310
In fact, every red dot on
this map here represents

402
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,450
a high school where there's a high
school teacher and class of students

403
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,890
who were taking CS50 in some
form, where their own teacher

404
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,540
has adopted or adapted the
curriculum, the same tools,

405
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,957
the same software that you all use
here in Cambridge and in New Haven

406
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:09,290
to actually teach introductory
computer science as well.

407
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,560
In blue, similarly, are
universities around the world

408
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,770
as well where we've been working with
faculty and student groups beyond.

409
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,860
In fact, here some of our friends
in Miami-Dade College in Florida.

410
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,720
Some of our friends here in Chile,
here in London, here in Burma,

411
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,510
here in Ukraine, here in Cairo,
here in Bolivia, here in Nicaragua.

412
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,080
And lastly, here on stage, our
very first cohort, so to speak,

413
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,130
of high school teachers teaching CS50
AP as of a couple of years ago, who then

414
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,150
went back through their school
districts to evangelize computer science

415
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,060
and empower students there to teach it.

416
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,580
And in fact, even though we ourselves
have our own hackathon coming up here

417
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,740
in just a couple of
weeks' time, so has there

418
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,990
been a CS50 hackathon for high schools.

419
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,720
In fact pictured here, was
our very first CS50 hackathon

420
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,070
for AP students, a mix of four public,
four private schools in Manhattan

421
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,950
some months ago, where everyone got
together to work on their own problems

422
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,650
sets, projects and the like.

423
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,670
So again, please feel free to engage
in any number of these ways and more.

424
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,950
So what did we do all
semester, and what will you

425
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,810
do if you continue to apply CS?

426
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,300
It's really all about
problem-solving, and we've certainly

427
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,200
solved quite a few problems, the last of
them last week with problem set eight.

428
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,240
If you're curious as to what your
classmates thought of the problem sets,

429
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,230
here we have blue means love, and purple
means hate, and each of these bars

430
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,720
represents problem set
zero through eight.

431
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,820
So you can kind of get
a sense where the love,

432
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,000
where the like, where the
neutral was, here in yellow.

433
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,990
And maybe there are some spikes
of hatred, maybe over down there.

434
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,700
But perhaps more revealingly
too is the difficulty

435
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,950
with which folks perceive these, and
this admittedly is retrospective.

436
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,640
So of course scratch was
pretty fun, pretty easy,

437
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,455
as was maybe Mario and so forth.

438
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:53,580
But you can get a sense of
some of the fluctuation.

439
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,290
And apparently, on the
heels of misspellings here,

440
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,640
we suddenly went to a lot of medium
difficulty when you simply had to port,

441
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,740
so to speak, some of your problems
from P-set one now for problem set six.

442
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,512
And in terms of demographically,
how your classmates

443
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,970
are engaging in the class, when
did you start problem sets?

444
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,530
Oh interesting.

445
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,840
So recall that problem sets
are released on Fridays,

446
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,630
and here we have Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

447
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,110
Oh hello, Wednesday is when
really a plurality of students

448
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,567
seem to begin their problem sets.

449
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,650
Not though perhaps
surprisingly, when it coincides

450
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,740
with office hours and sections
in the earlier days of the week.

451
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,440
And then in terms of when you
watch lectures, because indeed,

452
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,470
both here and in New Haven, most
students, they do engage online.

453
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,250
You can see that, with the lectures
live on Friday, many students watch

454
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,525
apparently shortly after 10:00
a.m. on Fridays, but on demand,

455
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,650
followed by the weekend,
and the most popular being

456
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,840
Monday before sections presumably.

457
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,660
So you too are somewhere
among those inputs.

458
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,300
But what were the problems
that we actually solved,

459
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,230
and what were really
the goals of the class?

460
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,660
It's not to teach C per se.

461
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,450
It's not to introduce JavaScript
or SQL or Python, all of which

462
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,160
are really just tools in a toolkit.

463
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,300
So that when you exit CS50 and go onto
some other class or some other field,

464
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,696
and want to actually solve problems
using data and using computation,

465
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,570
that you actually just have a mental
model with which to approach it,

466
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,950
and less of a fear factor.

467
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,190
So that even if you have absolutely
no idea how to write code in Ruby,

468
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,950
which your lab or your company,
your friends, happen to be using,

469
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,700
well, no big deal.

470
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,770
Much like in P-set
seven and eight, where

471
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,430
Google and Stack Overflow and friends
become your support structure,

472
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,940
realize that among the goals has been
to teach you to teach yourselves.

473
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,172
And undoubtedly, that comes
with some frustration,

474
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:33,380
in especially those recent
weeks, but the goal really

475
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,360
has been to take off
these training wheels, so

476
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,110
that when you're no longer handed a
spec for P-set zero through eight,

477
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,660
you at least have a sense
of where to go from here.

478
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,910
And indeed the final
project is about taking off

479
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,010
the final of those training wheels.

480
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,107
Now what does problem
solving itself mean?

481
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,940
We described that back
in week zero as this.

482
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,356
You have inputs to that problem,
and at the end of the day

483
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:57,600
you care about the outputs, and what was
inside of this black box, so to speak.

484
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,140
So algorithms, just
step-by-step instructions

485
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,020
for solving some problem, and
that's where the real insight is,

486
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,880
the real efficiency and
the real opportunity

487
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,080
to get things not only correct, but also
well-designed in addition to something

488
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,920
like well-styled.

489
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,060
And so as you approach
the solutions to problems,

490
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,340
I dare say maybe one of the most
thematic topics of this class,

491
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,400
and perhaps any other introductory
class, is this theme of trade-offs,

492
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,190
whether it's time and space,
or the computer's time

493
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,912
and space versus your time and space and
so forth when solving these problems.

494
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:27,620
And consider that
there's not necessarily

495
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,132
one right answer to these
kinds of design questions,

496
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:32,090
but hopefully you'll feel
all the more that you

497
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,970
can hold your own in a conversation
with someone as or even

498
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,180
more technical than you and
convince them of your perspective

499
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,390
and contribute to the solving
of some of these problems.

500
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,780
And among the other topics
that have been sort of manifest

501
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,837
throughout the semester
is this one, abstraction,

502
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:50,420
which really speaks to this very
general problem-solving tool.

503
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,628
If you've got some problem
ahead of you, whether it's

504
00:23:52,628 --> 00:23:54,740
something software-related
or real-world,

505
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,910
or really anything in between, this
idea of taking something complicated

506
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,370
and breaking it down into
its constituent parts,

507
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,550
so that you only have to
think about up at this level,

508
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,640
and you don't have to worry about
where the zeros and ones come from,

509
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,930
or where the characters on the
screen come from, and so forth.

510
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,846
Like the fact that we've kept layering
and layering and layering means

511
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:15,487
you could do so much more
with P-set seven and eight.

512
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,820
Even if it didn't feel like
it at the start of the week,

513
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,430
then you could with just C and
certainly with just binary alone.

514
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,780
So realize too, that
sort of bootstrapping

515
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,587
is thematic any time you're
learning some new topic.

516
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:29,420
And how do you express yourself
when trying to solve these problems?

517
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,426
Of course pseudocode.

518
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,300
And indeed, this should
become habit as well.

519
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,341
Doesn't really matter what
language you write in,

520
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,827
but I am still in the habit of
writing out comments for my programs,

521
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,910
and then therefore I kind of know the
outline, much like an English essay,

522
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,830
and then I kind of fill in the gaps
with the actual code thereafter.

523
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,830
Because the hard part,
and perhaps the fun part,

524
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,590
is really just thinking through
how you might solve something.

525
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,740
And in fact this was, this
feels like an opportune moment

526
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,717
to take a moment to see just
how well this has sunk in,

527
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:58,550
and how well we might apply some
of these most basic principles that

528
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,620
started in week zero and
then persisted throughout.

529
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,300
But for this, we need a
volunteer to come up on stage

530
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,300
and help me program everyone else.

531
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,540
Yeah, come on up.

532
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,040
All right.

533
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,770


534
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,663
What's your name?

535
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:15,550
Sorry?

536
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,050
Amy.

537
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,370
Amy, come on up.

538
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,640
Nice to meet you.

539
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,150
Now only Amy is about to
see what's on my screen,

540
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,130
and if the staff could
help me for just a moment.

541
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,620
Let me go ahead and cut to this.

542
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,710
I'll be right back.

543
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,710
We just need to quickly
hand out all this paper.

544
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,290
You can pull out a piece of
paper of your own if you have it,

545
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,440
but if the staff could kind of
divvy these up so that everyone

546
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,370
has a piece of paper.

547
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,680
Ideally, a pencil or pen.

548
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,800
If you don't, we have, pardon me, Amy.

549
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,290
A solution to that problem.

550
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,890
Everyone gets a free CS50
pen today if you'd like.

551
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,010
OK, very popular.

552
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,860
OK, so no one has a
pencil now, apparently.

553
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,580
All right.

554
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,100
So Amy, as you guys get
set up up there, I'm

555
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,730
about to show Amy something on
my screen, a picture to draw.

556
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,085
And you, much like the
programmer that you now are,

557
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:06,960
are going to program the audience
to actually draw what you see.

558
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,620
And we'll remember, from very early on,
that precision is probably important

559
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,370
here, but at the same
time, you don't want

560
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,330
to get tangled in the weeds
of zeros and ones so to speak.

561
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,250
You want ultimately
everyone in this audience,

562
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,100
ideally, to draw what it is
just you and I are seeing.

563
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,170
All right, so everyone
is unwrapping pens.

564
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,830
And hopefully you have a piece of paper,
though any piece of paper suffices.

565
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,850
I'm going to go ahead and
reveal what Amy is seeing here.

566
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:43,040
And the goal is, verbally only, to
tell the audience here what to draw.

567
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,330
And give everyone just a moment.

568
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,460
Get your paper in front of you,
pencil in hand or pen in hand.

569
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,560


570
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,690
And feels like we can begin.

571
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,440
AMY: OK, so I'm looking at a cube.

572
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,125
It's kind of like a Rubik's cube, but
I can only see three of the faces.

573
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:05,030


574
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,070
So there's a, this, oh.

575
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:14,690
So there is the top of the
Rubik's cube and two sides.

576
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:23,760
The top looks like a diamond, so you
want to draw the diamond on the top.

577
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,960
And then the two sides
come down from that,

578
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,110
so it looks like you're looking
at a Rubik's cube from the corner.

579
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,990
And it's not actually Rubik's
cube, so don't draw the lines.

580
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,280
It's just like a normal cube.

581
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,441
I don't know how else to describe it.

582
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,190
DAVID MALAN: Exit?

583
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:44,710
AMY: Exit.

584
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,540
DAVID MALAN: OK.

585
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,110
So thank you so much to Amy.

586
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,160
Round of applause, if we could,
for getting us to this point.

587
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,340
Now comes, feel free to
partake back down there.

588
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,940
Now we just need that staff to help
grab some of these pieces of paper.

589
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,110
We'll do pseudo-random samples and
we'll take a look at correctness,

590
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,450
if not artistic design here.

591
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,340
Some folks still going past
the buzzer, but that's OK.

592
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,850
All right, I'm going to go
ahead and cue up my screen here.

593
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,550


594
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:21,810
In just a moment, we'll actually
reveal how some of these came out.

595
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:28,700


596
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,310
All right, that's good.

597
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,320
Thank you so much.

598
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,760
All right, so notice in particular
though, that what Amy was doing

599
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,111
was actually leveraging
abstraction, as it turned out.

600
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:39,610
Right?

601
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,490
She was telling you to draw shapes
that are hopefully familiar,

602
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,520
toys that are hopefully familiar,
and those of course are abstractions.

603
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,290
Because it would get
pretty mundane and pretty

604
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,925
low-level if she had to start
describing what a Rubik's cube is

605
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:50,800
or what a diamond is.

606
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,200
Hopefully these are
abstractions all of us know,

607
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,120
at least the diamond shape and so forth,
and the cube shape from yesteryear,

608
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,630
so at least we have
that same mental model.

609
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,080
So let's take a look at a few
of the shapes that we have here.

610
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,720
Here, we have one, two,
three attempts to draw,

611
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,110
but that perhaps is reminiscent
of what some of you drew as well.

612
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:14,410
This one here is super small.

613
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,700
We didn't really speak to scaling,
but that does look like a cube.

614
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,580
Perhaps not necessarily
oriented as she intended.

615
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
This one's kind of cute.

616
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,560


617
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,290
But we love them all
equally, whoever's this is.

618
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,250
In fairness, this one's
sort of Inception-like.

619
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,360
Or, oh I see.

620
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,180
Diamond on top of the cube, I get it.

621
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,600
This one's a little
bloated at the bottom.

622
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,350
OK, this one's actually quite beautiful.

623
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,760
Here we have this one here.

624
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,600
Very nice.

625
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,790
And I think she was
describing it this way.

626
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,020
And in fact, if I go back
to what Amy was seeing,

627
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,970
the answer was this one here.

628
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,090
So a big round of applause,
if we could, for Amy.

629
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,960
But now, let's flip things around.

630
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,260
Here we need one more volunteer
to come on up if you could.

631
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,220
OK, come on up.

632
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,320


633
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,080
And what is your name?

634
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,580
Dylan.

635
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,680
Dylan, come on up.

636
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,230
So here, we'll turn the tables a bit.

637
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,160
Thank you so much.

638
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,520
Welcome to keep those pens and the
sheets of paper if you still have them.

639
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,480
Let me go ahead here and
blank the screen again

640
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,260
and give Dylan a piece
of chalk if we could.

641
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,080
And so if you could come
on over here, what we

642
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,660
have here is a canvas on which you can
draw what the audience tells you to do.

643
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,070
And in fact, since the
answer is going to be there,

644
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,030
we're going to push this back after all.

645
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,344
And the only thing you
can't do is look up.

646
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,760
All right, so look straight ahead.

647
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,160
Here's your piece of chalk.

648
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,380
And now, what the audience is going
to see is what you need to draw,

649
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,290
and we'll take it one instruction at
a time to tell Dylan what to draw.

650
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,430
All right, the drawing is--

651
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,800
Who would like to contribute
the first instruction?

652
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,230
And also don't look to your right,
because there are answers everywhere.

653
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,980
Yes.

654
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,350
AUDIENCE: Draw a circle in
the middle of the board.

655
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,600
DAVID MALAN: Draw a circle
in the middle of the board.

656
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,594


657
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:11,760
AUDIENCE: Smaller than that.

658
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,065
DAVID MALAN: Smaller than that.

659
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:16,319


660
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:16,860
There you go.

661
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,660
AUDIENCE: Erase the big circle.

662
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,100
DAVID MALAN: Erase the big circle.

663
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,380
AUDIENCE: Draw a line
going down the circle.

664
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,760
DAVID MALAN: Draw a line
going down the circle.

665
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,010
OK, wait, we need to buffer, buffer.

666
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,910
Hang on.

667
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,910
No.

668
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,830
Undo.

669
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,590
OK, let's restart.

670
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,575
Step one, draw a--

671
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:40,950
AUDIENCE: Draw a small circle
in the middle of the board.

672
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,410
DAVID MALAN: Draw a small circle
in the middle of the board, Dylan.

673
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,270
AUDIENCE: Keep it.

674
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:44,840
DAVID MALAN: Keep it.

675
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,423
We'll take it.

676
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:46,250
OK, step two.

677
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,980
AUDIENCE: Stick figures
with no arms yet.

678
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,170
DAVID MALAN: Draw a stick
figure with no arms yet.

679
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,074
Nice abstraction.

680
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:55,002
AUDIENCE: The head is the circle.

681
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:55,966
The circle's the head.

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,257
Step five.

first, and it will look like a Y.

congratulations to Dylan.

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,360


768
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,340
That's pretty good.

769
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,260
Pretty good, thank you so much.

770
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,240
So realize, fun as this is,
it's actually non-trivial

771
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,730
to convert these
abstractions with which we're

772
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,050
familiar to things that computers, or in
some cases humans, actually understand.

773
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,060
So realize here too, there's this trade.

774
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,480
Like, saying draw a stick figure
is a very useful abstraction,

775
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,870
but the problem, of course, is that
the precision isn't necessarily there

776
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,650
if you're seeking one particular goal.

777
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,630
So beyond problem solving in
this way and in this class

778
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,190
what more can you do after CS50?

779
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,580
So if you take a look at
that unofficial guide to CS

780
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,380
that we'll link soon on
CS50's website as well,

781
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,670
you can go off in so many
other directions from here

782
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,920
to the direction of hardware,
software, graphics, theory, statistics,

783
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,057
mathematics, and more.

784
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,890
And indeed increasingly,
to the intersection

785
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,100
of computer science with other
worlds, like economics and now

786
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,200
machine learning, which is being
applied to all sorts of fields as well.

787
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,490
And in fact even I years ago have very
fond memories of some of these classes

788
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,040
and only a handful of these
even existed years ago.

789
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,406
I still remember to this day taking
CS141, which is a hardware class,

790
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:55,280
and even though these days much of
it's been virtualized in software,

791
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,155
back in the day we had tiny little
wires and tiny little breadboards,

792
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:01,190
and debugging back in
my day was literally

793
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,076
a matter of grabbing all of the wires
that had just frustrated you to no end

794
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:07,700
and literally ripping them out
of something called a breadboard

795
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,930
and starting over.

796
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,820
Nowadays you can do so
much more in software,

797
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,460
and can conceptualize things
all the more effectively

798
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,960
because of enhancements since.

799
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,539
And perhaps after CS50,
one of my favorite classes,

800
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,330
probably my favorite
class as an undergrad,

801
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,940
was CS161, an operating systems class.

802
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,160
We actually build pieces
of an operating system

803
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,440
which would be akin to
the features of Mac OS

804
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,212
and Windows and Linux and the like.

805
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:31,670
And so realize even if you're
among those less comfortable,

806
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,420
there's so many different
stepping stones.

807
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,217
So do chat with your TF or myself or
the course's heads or any of the CAs

808
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:39,050
about what directions
in which you might go.

809
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,720
And even if you don't have
the time or necessarily

810
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,010
the interest on campus
in doing these things,

811
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,210
there are so many courses online
beyond this particular campus

812
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,680
too, on EdX and Coursera and the like so
don't under appreciate the ability now

813
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,800
to go teach yourself new things
albeit with the structure of some

814
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,900
of these freely available classes.

815
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,250
But how about some
concrete steps now too,

816
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,272
as to what you can do after CS50 to
actually solve problems and write code?

817
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:04,980
Because at the end of
the day, you're not

818
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,646
going to be handed necessarily
these problem set specifications.

819
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:09,740
You're not necessarily
going to have a TF or CA

820
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,830
to whom you could ask questions with
which they themselves are already

821
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,550
familiar.

822
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,580
You're a bit more on your own in
terms of teaching yourself new things.

823
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,580
So long as, though, you take
advantage of these resources,

824
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,230
can you succeed at exactly that.

825
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,380
Now you're welcome to continue using
something like CS50 IDE for as long

826
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,130
as you would like.

827
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,400
Your accounts will keep working.

828
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,250
And that's meant to be
pretty representative

829
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,660
of a real-world environment.

830
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,750
But of course it's cloud-based, and
so if you're on a plane or a train

831
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,600
or in some of the dorms or houses
where the Wi-Fi isn't so great,

832
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,980
might not work so well.

833
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,160
And so increasingly, comment
after taking one class

834
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,850
would be to start installing these
kinds of tools on your own Mac or PC.

835
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,620
So we'll put these
slides up later as well

836
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,340
so that you have all of these URLs,
but if you'd like, on your Mac or PC,

837
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,820
whether it's over Thanksgiving or J-term
or beyond, install some command line

838
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,647
tools on your Mac or PC.

839
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:56,480
This means having a
command line environment

840
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,200
on your Mac as suggested here,
which actually comes with Mac OS.

841
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,600
If you install something for
free called Xcode and more,

842
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,480
you get a whole suite of
command line utilities.

843
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,840
In the world of Windows,
you can actually

844
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,548
install a command line
environment that's

845
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:10,400
much better than the built-in
command prompt with which

846
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,900
you might be familiar, so that
it behaves just like Linux.

847
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,360
It's essentially running Linux
on your own Windows machine.

848
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,630
Now git, this is something you guys
indirectly use throughout the semester

849
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,790
any time you ran Submit 50.

850
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,120
But really, all Submit 50 does is run
a few different commands, all of them

851
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,290
called git.

852
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,517
This is a version control
software, and it's

853
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:31,850
just one of several different
versions, but git probably

854
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,410
has the most traction these days.

855
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,260
And if you are still in the
habit, and even occasionally I'm

856
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,968
guilty of this too,
at least in the world

857
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:41,870
of writing essays and letters, if
you're in the habit of copying a file

858
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,080
and then naming it version
two, or copying a file

859
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,299
and naming it Thursday night,
and then Friday morning,

860
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,840
and all of these different
deltas, that is not a good system,

861
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,791
because you're not
leveraging the computer

862
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,790
to keep track of the differences,
especially so that you can rewind back

863
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,510
in time.

864
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,500
So a program like git actually lets
you keep track of all of your changes

865
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,860
and you have an Infinite history of
all of the work you've ever done.

866
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,430
Brian here nicely enough has
given a seminar on how to use git

867
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,640
and in turn GitHub.

868
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,660
On GitHub itself, if
you haven't already, you

869
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,874
can sign up for free
private repositories, which

870
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:16,540
means you can store your coursework
and your own work privately,

871
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,730
so they're not in public repos,
since to date all of your work

872
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,911
has been in CS50's account, but you
yourselves can start using your own.

873
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:25,410
If you do this, you can just
fill out the prompts like this,

874
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,170
saying you're students wanting
an individual account for free.

875
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,400
And then you can install git
itself on your own Mac or PC

876
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,250
as by following instructions here.

877
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,840
But what about actually writing code?

878
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,660
I mean theoretically, you
can use most any text editing

879
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,425
program on your computer, like TextEdit
on Mac OS or Notepad on Windows,

880
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:44,800
but these are not very good
tools in that they don't have

881
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,140
any features that are code-friendly.

882
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,300
But it's very easy to
install something like this.

883
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,299
This is super popular
among students these days,

884
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,310
Sublime Text, as well as software
engineers in the real world.

885
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,210
It gives you features like syntax
highlighting and nice indentation

886
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,710
features, and even
auto-complete and more.

887
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,890
And so this would be a
tool much like the IDE

888
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,140
that you can use on your own Mac or PC.

889
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,430
An alternative that's also
free for use here is Atom.

890
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,160
It behaves very similarly, and that
too is something you can try as well.

891
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,180
If you'd like to go a little deeper
and use some older school tools that

892
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,079
are very much still in
use, myself included,

893
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,620
because they're perhaps all the
more powerful in that they're

894
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,380
much more command-line based,
Vim is a very popular one.

895
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,450
If you add this
autocomplete plug-in, you'll

896
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,450
have very similar capabilities even
within that environment as well.

897
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:33,550
Now as for final projects, many students
end up making web-based applications,

898
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,950
maybe borrowing P-set
seven or P-set eight's code

899
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,960
and then adding and contributing
their own when ripping out

900
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,060
things that are P-set
specific, you can certainly

901
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,167
use CS50 IDE to host that
website so that friends

902
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,000
at the fair and then friends in the
houses and dorms can try it out,

903
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,980
or friends back home.

904
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,360
But of course with these
free accounts, they

905
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,060
tend to turn off just to save
resources after not using it

906
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,800
for a few hours or days.

907
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,870
You can at least though,
in the short term,

908
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:59,500
enable this by going to the
Share icon, and CS50 IDE,

909
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,305
selecting public for the
application, and then any friends who

910
00:42:02,305 --> 00:42:04,180
visit a URL that looks
like that can actually

911
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,240
see your P-set seven,
your P-set eight, or soon,

912
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,130
your final project If it's web based.

913
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,980
But a lot cooler ultimately,
and a lot more practical

914
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,145
if you want this thing to survive
in perpetuity and just run 24/7,

915
00:42:16,145 --> 00:42:18,520
would be to use some of these
third-party cloud services.

916
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,400
Heroku is a very
popular service that has

917
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,460
you install a little bit of
software on your Mac or PC, and then

918
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,440
sort of magically
thereafter, anytime you

919
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,430
run a command, any code you've been
working on your Mac or PC gets pushed

920
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,190
to the cloud, so to speak,
deployed to Heroku servers,

921
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,456
and then it can live at your own
domain name, either a default one

922
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:38,830
you get for free, but if you
want something a little more

923
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,430
custom, can you actually buy or
for free get your own domain name.

924
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,760
Amazon has something called AWS Educate,
which you can use for free as well,

925
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,070
and there's bunches
of other services too.

926
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,260
In fact, there's a
company called Namecheap,

927
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,840
which is not only cheap,
it's also free for students

928
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,050
if you want to buy your own domain
name for your final project or beyond,

929
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,490
head to a URL like this one here.

930
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,070
And then lastly, GitHub itself, beyond
offering version control software,

931
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,680
is partnered with bunches of companies
that just give free levels of service

932
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,897
to students as well.

933
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:08,980
So if you go get this
developer pack, so to speak,

934
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,730
you'll see even more options that
you can use for some amount of time

935
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,810
to learn from and actually use
compellingly these kinds of services.

936
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,720
So what remains and what lies ahead?

937
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,340
Well of course, we'll be seeing that
the CS50 hackathon, the CS50 fair.

938
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,944
More on those in just a moment.

939
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:29,110
But you're also at the point now where
you've seen a lot of languages right?

940
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,980
Scratch and C, and Python
and SQL, and JavaScript.

941
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,320
And increasingly if you spend time
in this world of CS and programming,

942
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
and if you Google and
read up on Stack Overflow,

943
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,300
you're going to find that
it's a pretty religious world

944
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,008
among some people, where everyone
has these strong opinions, sort

945
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:44,210
of correct or incorrect.

946
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,860
And so I would encourage you to be
as open-minded here on out as to what

947
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,510
the right solutions to problems are.

948
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,290
It is rarely the case that there is one
thing only you should use and realize

949
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,360
that a lot of programmers,
myself included,

950
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,330
will bring to the table biases
that you should keep in mind

951
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,300
and push back on if you think a
problem could be solved differently.

952
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,610
And realize too it's
all about trade-offs.

953
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,940
And this, to kind of paint this
picture of the various idiosyncrasies

954
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,900
of languages is a wonderful short talk
that a fellow gave at a conference

955
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,220
a few years ago wherein he pointed out
that all languages, the ones especially

956
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,380
that he excerpted, have
these weird features.

957
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,254
And so if you encounter
someone in life who's

958
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:22,281
like oh, PHP is bad because of this
or Python is bad because of that,

959
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,280
well you could probably
come up with those kinds

960
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,030
of sentences about any language.

961
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,860
But what's cool now is that
we've seen enough languages

962
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,560
and perhaps formed enough opinions
that some of the examples you're

963
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,580
about to see should on their face
be a little nonsensical or weird,

964
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,880
and it's more like programming trivia,
but hopefully now some 12 weeks later,

965
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,601
these examples of programming
idiosyncrasies will make sense.

966
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:44,350
Let's take a look.

967
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,010


968
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,530
All right, good.

969
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,102
You guys know what WAT means?

970
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:56,210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

971
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,600
Exactly, exactly.

972
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,730
Let's talk about JavaScript.

973
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,690


974
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,367
Does anyone know in JavaScript
what array plus array is?

975
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:09,700
Well, let me ask you this first.

976
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,933
What should array + array be?

977
00:45:11,933 --> 00:45:12,880
AUDIENCE: Empty array.

978
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,921
DAVID MALAN: Empty array.

979
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,430
I would also accept type error.

980
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,840
That is not what array + array is.

981
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,980
Wrong.

982
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,020
Wrong.

983
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,420
Array plus array is empty string.

984
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,320


985
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,910
Obviously.

986
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:30,010
I think that's obvious to everyone.

987
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,780
Now what would array + object be?

988
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,404
This would obviously be TypeError,
because those are completely

989
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:35,630
disparate types.

990
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,880
Does anyone know what this is?

991
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,860
AUDIENCE: Default.

992
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,530
DAVID MALAN: No.

993
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,030
Close.

994
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,622
No, far away.

995
00:45:40,622 --> 00:45:41,330
AUDIENCE: Object.

996
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,630
DAVID MALAN: It's object.

997
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,920
Right, nicely done.

998
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,730
Now of course, because this is
plus, so you can flip the operands

999
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,080
and the same thing comes out.

1000
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,840
So if we do, what?

1001
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,490
No that's just an object.

1002
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,440
If you do object + arrays, you
get exactly the same thing,

1003
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,940
which as you can see you do.

1004
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,560


1005
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,920
And finally, the only one of
these that's actually true

1006
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,997
is, because you know
you add arrays, you get

1007
00:46:08,997 --> 00:46:10,580
empty string, that doesn't make sense.

1008
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,230
But an object plus an object is
actually not a number, technically.

1009
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,350
So this one's actually right.

1010
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,620
And exactly, right?

1011
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,070
Like, what is even
going on in this last?

1012
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:29,117
I just, I don't even understand what
person with a brain in their head

1013
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:30,950
would think that any
of this is a good idea.

1014
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,630


1015
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,130
OK, OK, enough making fun
of languages that suck.

1016
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,030
Let's talk about JavaScript.

1017
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,230
If I say array.new 16,
or just array 16, I

1018
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,125
get an array of 16 things
which it represents

1019
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,720
as 16 commas, which is obvious.

1020
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:56,030
And if I then join those with a
string, then I get the string 16 times.

1021
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,620
This is actually the only line in this
entire presentation that's reasonable.

1022
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,830
Now if I take that string
and then add a 1 to it,

1023
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,260
it interprets the 1 as, or
casts the 1 to a string,

1024
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,210
and then we get WAT 1 a bunch of times.

1025
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,260
Fine.

1026
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,200
Does anyone know what will
happen if I subtract 1 from this?

1027
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,969


1028
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,010
I'm assuming no one does.

1029
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,480
Let me, I'll give you a hint.

1030
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,860
Does this help?

1031
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,741
Does anyone know?

1032
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:23,324
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1033
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:31,911


1034
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:32,786
DAVID MALAN: WAT-man.

1035
00:47:32,786 --> 00:47:36,790


1036
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:41,270
So programmer humor, just a
little taste of it there as well.

1037
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,450
What comes next?

1038
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,450
We will wrap a bit early,
probably in about 10--

1039
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1040
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,560
DAVID MALAN: OK.

1041
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,330
So we'll wrap in about 10 or so minutes.

1042
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,690
Before then, we want to give you a
teaser of what lies ahead and why.

1043
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,180
So the CS50 hackathon of
course, here on campus,

1044
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,200
is about working on, alongside
classmates final projects,

1045
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,149
and having some 12 hours or
so in which to dive into them,

1046
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:05,690
not only to actually get something
useful and productive done

1047
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,898
and feel good about it, but
also we hope about having

1048
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:11,060
a particularly memorable experience
among all of the course's staff

1049
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,440
and all of your classmates.

1050
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,400
It's not meant to be 12 hours of office
hours, but really 12 hours of fun

1051
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,550
problem-solving with the wonderful
support structure of everyone around.

1052
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,030
Upon arrival, you'll
check in like this here.

1053
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,590
You'll get set up in HBS's
Hives across the river, where

1054
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,744
we had CS50 Puzzle Day.

1055
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:28,160
And throughout the evening,
well, you work with each other

1056
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,740
or on your own projects,
solving problems

1057
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,850
ultimately to get to an end of having
a project that's either good or better

1058
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,550
or best as per your proposals.

1059
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,470
Around 9:00 PM, we'll order
in some Felipe's, quite a bit.

1060
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:44,400
Around 1:00 AM, we'll order
quite a bit of pizza as well.

1061
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,340
And then throughout
the evening, will there

1062
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,310
be not only photo booth
for some souvenir photos.

1063
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:53,360
One of CS50's own therapy
dogs will be on display

1064
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,820
to chat with and get to know.

1065
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,860
Yes, shoutout to Milo here.

1066
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,140
And then of course, shortly
after this, around 2:00,

1067
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,770
3:00 AM, such things as this do happen.

1068
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,680
But if you can make it through
the evening, at 5:00 AM,

1069
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,842
will literally CS50
shuttle show up and take

1070
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:11,300
those of you who would like to
have a culminating breakfast

1071
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,950
over down the street to IHOP.

1072
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,019
And then just a week or
so later is the CS50 fair,

1073
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,810
an opportunity to show
off what you've done

1074
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,240
and what you've learned
to all of your classmates

1075
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,010
here, but also others across campus.

1076
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,560
In attendance every
year some 2,000 students

1077
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,020
and faculty and staff
from across Harvard,

1078
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,200
some from the surrounding area
high schools as well, all of whom

1079
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,330
are here to see what
you have pulled off.

1080
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,060
So here is a glimpse for instance
of last year's CS50 fair.

1081
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,240
We'll set up laptops and
tables and music and food,

1082
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,760
and really just have
you offer an opportunity

1083
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,660
to delight in what everyone here
has pulled off during the semester

1084
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,730
and hardware demonstrations as well.

1085
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:50,030
Also in attendance will be some
friends and recruiters and alumni

1086
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:50,900
from industry.

1087
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,850
Pictured here is one of
the city's former TFs

1088
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,160
who actually turned himself
into a software engineer

1089
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,570
having taken CS50 as a senior
concentrating in social studies,

1090
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,750
and then really bootstrapped himself
in the few years after graduation

1091
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,855
to then have a job at
Google writing software.

1092
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:07,730
And of course you'll
receive at the very end,

1093
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:12,060
hopefully, this proud statement
that you took indeed CS50,

1094
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,230
and so that will be presented
at the CS50 fair as well.

1095
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,930
In just a little bit we'll
adjourn to the pub downstairs,

1096
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,420
where Aaron and Brian and
Maria and the whole team

1097
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,630
will be waiting to say hello
and congratulations with CS50's

1098
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,660
traditional cupcakes, but
before then we thought

1099
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,520
we'd invite a few of
the staff up on stage

1100
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,240
to participate in an
annual CS50 tradition,

1101
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,860
especially in the spirit of
this weekend's competition.

1102
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,500
But this one not so much Harvard
versus Yale, but students versus staff.

1103
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,172
If we might get four brave
volunteers to come on up?

1104
00:50:44,172 --> 00:50:45,380
OK, I saw one hand over here.

1105
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,070
Come on up.

1106
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,510
OK, one hand over here.

1107
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,880
One hand over here, and
a fourth hand over here.

1108
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,560
Come on up.

1109
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,100
Thank you so much to
our volunteers here.

1110
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,802
Right there, that's fine, yeah.

1111
00:50:57,802 --> 00:50:58,510
What's your name?

1112
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,134
ANDREA: Andrea.

1113
00:50:59,134 --> 00:50:59,167


1114
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,000
DAVID MALAN: Andrea.

1115
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,290
David.

1116
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,998
Nice to meet you.

1117
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:01,740
Right this way.

1118
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,527
We'll get some chairs.

1119
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:02,940
WILL: Will.

1120
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,200
DAVID MALAN: Will.

1121
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,908
Nice to meet you.

1122
00:51:03,908 --> 00:51:04,550
Right this way.

1123
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,090
OLIVIA: Olivia.

1124
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:05,440
DAVID MALAN: Olivia.

1125
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,130
Nice to see you.

1126
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,830
Right this way.

1127
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,190
And--

1128
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,610
HANNAH: Hannah.

1129
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,443
DAVID MALAN: Hannah.

1130
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,110
Right this way.

1131
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,390
We've got four chairs for
staff, four chairs for students.

1132
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:18,360


1133
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,721
All right thank you.

1134
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,020
Go on, let's put the
tablecloths up there too.

1135
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,740
And Colton, we can spin this around.

1136
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,965
Let's have the students
sit over there on my right.

1137
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,870
Thank you.

1138
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,620
And the staff will sit
over to their left.

1139
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,750
Thank you.

1140
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,430
And here we have, excellent.

1141
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,930
Excellent.

1142
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,957
And you want to do some
dramatic flair here.

1143
00:51:43,957 --> 00:51:46,040
All right, so you guys are
in charge of that. one.

1144
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,498
You guys are in charge of that one.

1145
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:49,490
Just keep the pen and paper there.

1146
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,310
Oh, and even better.

1147
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,220
Yes, let's see.

1148
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,650
Let's see if we can do a
dramatic flourish here.

1149
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,320
I think we can do better for you guys.

1150
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,700


1151
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,502
Yes.

1152
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:09,960
You guys get the better tablecloth.

1153
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,340
There we go, OK.

1154
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,810
All right, so you may recall,
as part of problem set eight,

1155
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,140
we asked you a few
quiz review questions.

1156
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,500
Not all of them made the
cut into the actual quiz.

1157
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:29,770
There was a lot of what is HTTP
stand for and what is HTML stand for?

1158
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:30,930
But that's OK.

1159
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,770
We went through the
list and culled a few

1160
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:38,514
that we'll use here for CS50's
annual student v. staff Jeopardy.

1161
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:41,680
Because the questions were written in
the form of questions and not answers,

1162
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,600
we'll simply read them as is.

1163
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,290
We've excerpted a number of categories
from which your own classmates wrote

1164
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,310
questions.

1165
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:53,920
We don't have buzzers, but we
do have things that squeak, so.

1166
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,307
We have four of these.

1167
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:57,640
So if you just squeak the
duck if you'd like to buzz in.

1168
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,940
Colton will help me adjudicate
as to whose hand went up first.

1169
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,630
And let's go ahead and put a
microphone, here microphone here,

1170
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,270
and before we begin, perhaps some
quick hellos of name and dorm or house

1171
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,517
into the microphones.

1172
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:14,151


1173
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:14,650
OLIVIA: Hi.

1174
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,520
I'm Olivia.

1175
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,990
I'm a freshman and I'm in Wigg.

1176
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:23,070
HANNAH: Hi, I'm Hannah, and I'm a first
year at Graduate School of Design.

1177
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:23,735
WILL: Hi guys.

1178
00:53:23,735 --> 00:53:24,630
I'm Will Yao.

1179
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,900
I live in Grays.

1180
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,400
ANDREA: Hi.

1181
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,120
I'm Andrea.

1182
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,180
I'm a senior in Mather.

1183
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,790


1184
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,180
DAVID MALAN: And let's
now meet the staff.

1185
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,822
ERIN: I'm Erin.

1186
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:36,530
ARMAV: I'm Armav.

1187
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,609
I'm a sophomore in Eliot.

1188
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:39,400
THOMAS: I'm Thomas.

1189
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,280
I'm a senior in Kirkland.

1190
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,060
MARIA: Maria, senior in Cabot.

1191
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,310
DAVID MALAN: And so perfect
that Maria is up here too,

1192
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:49,060
because I went through our archives,
and if we look back some four years,

1193
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,009
there she is as well.

1194
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:54,925
When apparently it was fashionable
to wear Google Glass around campus.

1195
00:53:54,925 --> 00:53:57,640


1196
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,700
So here we have our Jeopardy
board, implemented in HTML.

1197
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,252
And we have single Jeopardy ahead.

1198
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:06,460
We won't run the whole board.

1199
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:09,400
Just a few choice examples
from each category.

1200
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,381
Before we began, students
won the coin toss,

1201
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,880
so you guys will get to pick
the category and dollar amount.

1202
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,796
I'll ask the question.

1203
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,990
Colton will kindly keep
track of the score,

1204
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,660
and we'll see how this turns out.

1205
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,970
Before we adjourn for cupcakes.

1206
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,100
What topic would you guys like?

1207
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,290
OK, Scratch for?

1208
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,160
AUDIENCE: $200.

1209
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,230
DAVID MALAN: Scratch for $200.

1210
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,200
First one to squeak gets the answer.

1211
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,980
Which puzzle piece starts the program?

1212
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,431
I think I heard students.

1213
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:41,180
ANDREA: The flag one?

1214
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,912
DAVID MALAN: Yes the one flag clicked.

1215
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:44,870
What color is the flag?

1216
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,453
ANDREA: Green?

1217
00:54:45,453 --> 00:54:48,140
DAVID MALAN: When green flag
clicked is correct, for $200.

1218
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,900
Very good.

1219
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,469
Very nice.

1220
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:53,010
You're still in control of the board.

1221
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:58,200


1222
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,582
OLIVIA: Let's take-- memory?

1223
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:02,922
[INAUDIBLE]

1224
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:04,330
Memory for $400.

1225
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,190
DAVID MALAN: Memory for $400.

1226
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:07,580
Stepping it up.

1227
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:13,300
So for Memory, how much
memory does a byte have?

1228
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,962
Also didn't make the quiz.

1229
00:55:14,962 --> 00:55:15,670
THOMAS: One byte.

1230
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:19,150


1231
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,410
Eight bits?

1232
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,880
DAVID MALAN: I'll take
eight bits, yes, for $400.

1233
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,940
Staff are now in control.

1234
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,890
Nicely done, Thomas.

1235
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,370
Yes, a byte is a byte.

1236
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,410
What category would you all like next?

1237
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,560
Whoa, wait.

1238
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,070
THOMAS: Algorithms for $400.

1239
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,220
DAVID MALAN: What for four?

1240
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,386
THOMAS: Algorithms for $400.

1241
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:41,890
DAVID MALAN: Algorithms for $400.

1242
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:47,950
So in Algorithms, we have the
following question for you.

1243
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,050
What is the Big O?

1244
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,798


1245
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:53,080
I heard it over here.

1246
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,580
WILL: It's used to
describe time complexity.

1247
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,760
DAVID MALAN: Used to
describe time complexity.

1248
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,532
Correct for $400.

1249
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:04,660
Wonderful Students are in control
and are currently up to $600.

1250
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,970
Still taking the lead again.

1251
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,854
What would you like next?

1252
00:56:08,854 --> 00:56:09,850
STUDENTS: C.

1253
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:14,300
DAVID MALAN: C. For $400.

1254
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,200
C for $400.

1255
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,850
We're going to go with--

1256
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,200


1257
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,650
why did we start with C?

1258
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,320
And there's no answer.

1259
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,130
Go ahead.

1260
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,226
I heard you squeak first.

1261
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,833
WILL: Because if we started
with something else, going to C

1262
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,052
would be terrible.

1263
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:40,010
DAVID MALAN: Starting with something
else going to C would be terrible.

1264
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,709
Staff, what do you think?

1265
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:42,250
THOMAS: Sure.

1266
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,250
DAVID MALAN: All right, for $400.

1267
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,470
That was C for $400.

1268
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,830
We have time for just one or two more
questions here in Single Jeopardy.

1269
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:52,459
Students are still in control
and really winning now.

1270
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:53,500
OLIVIA: C for a thousand.

1271
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,749
DAVID MALAN: C for a thousand.

1272
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,760
Oh my goodness.

1273
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,130
All right, remember to buzz in.

1274
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,900


1275
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,468
What is the ending punctuation
to each line of code in order--

1276
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:10,870


1277
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,360
I heard I think the staff first.

1278
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,200
Yes?

1279
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,005
THOMAS: Semi-colon I hope.

1280
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:16,860
DAVID MALAN: It's the staff's turn.

1281
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,720
Semi-colon for $1,000.

1282
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,070
Excellent.

1283
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:26,030
I think then it's time for us to move
to Double Jeopardy here, at which point

1284
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:30,090
the dollar amounts increase
by a factor of two.

1285
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,510
We have time for a few
questions in this category.

1286
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,180
Staff are now in control.
$1,400 to $1,000.

1287
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,340
STAFFER: Data structure, $2,000.

1288
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,230
THOMAS: Data structures
for $2,000, please.

1289
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,310
DAVID MALAN: Data structures.

1290
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:46,320
Data structures for $2,000.

1291
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,981
Data structures for $2,000.

1292
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:48,480
Here we go.

1293
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,930
Data structures for $2,000.

1294
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,156
How many children does a
node have in a binary tree?

1295
00:57:56,156 --> 00:57:57,030
Oh I heard over here.

1296
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,610
Yours didn't work.

1297
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,180
Your duck didn't work.

1298
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,230
Two is correct.

1299
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,340


1300
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,755
Two is correct for $2,000.

1301
00:58:06,755 --> 00:58:08,600
Time for one or two more questions.

1302
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,230
Students are back in
control, $3,000 to $1,400.

1303
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,860
WILL: Python for $2,000.

1304
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,050
DAVID MALAN: Python for $2,000.

1305
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,110
Python for $2,000.

1306
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,860
Python for two.

1307
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:27,580
OK, how do you say, for $2,000, else-if?

1308
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,210
You think Erin?

1309
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,793
All right, your duck worked this time.

1310
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:30,440
ERIN: LF?

1311
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,900
DAVID MALAN: LF is correct for $2,000.

1312
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,750
You're now at $3,400.

1313
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,195
OK, don't have the
support of the audience.

1314
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:43,130
Time for one more question before
Final Jeopardy and cupcakes.

1315
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,334
What will your category
and dollar amount be?

1316
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:50,360
MARIA: Let's do HTTP, $2,000.

1317
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,450
DAVID MALAN: HTTP for $2,000.

1318
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,120
Really going to pull ahead with
this question, potentially.

1319
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,110
HTTP for $2,000.

1320
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:05,380
HTTP for $2,000.

1321
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,530
OK, when asked for a
question about HTTP,

1322
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,250
your classmate asked us to
ask the following question.

1323
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,170
Laughing my ass off.

1324
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,390
Just use the cat
questions from the test.

1325
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,470
Asked by-- We'll try another.

1326
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,550
We'll try another.

1327
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:31,530
We are going to go with get coffee.

1328
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:35,360
HTTP/1.1.

1329
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,430
MARIA: What?

1330
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:39,260
OLIVIA: Something I'm a teapot?

1331
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,340
DAVID MALAN: Yes, students.

1332
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,935
OLIVIA: It's the I'm a teapot error.

1333
00:59:45,935 --> 00:59:48,910
Okay, sorry, I'll pass it on to you.

1334
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,228
DAVID MALAN: No that
was correct, though.

1335
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,090
Nicely done. $2,000.

1336
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,950
So now, this was an
old April Fool's joke,

1337
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,870
where it was introduced
as a joke, HTTP 418.

1338
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:05,890
So now, we're at time for
the Final Jeopardy question

1339
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,040
where, for this question you
have a piece of paper and a pen.

1340
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,630
The staff have $3,400.

1341
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,460
The students have $5,000, so
there's some strategy here.

1342
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,840
You're going to first need to decide
on a dollar amount knowing only

1343
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,460
what the category is.

1344
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,690
The category is going
to be web programming.

1345
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,390
How much would you like to
wager on web programming?

1346
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,100
MARIA: All of it.

1347
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,190
DAVID MALAN: Oh, I don't think
you're supposed to tell me yet.

1348
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,990
In Jeopardy, yes.

1349
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,170
And we also need, let me
grab just our song here.

1350
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,182
Stand by one second.

1351
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:38,890
And students, if you could write
down how much you want to wager,

1352
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:41,140
strategically not knowing
what the staff is wagering.

1353
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,310


1354
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,380
We need, here we go.

1355
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,720
ANDREA: I don't know.

1356
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,620
DAVID MALAN: OK, so you
are wagering some amount.

1357
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,540
And you guys are wagering.

1358
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,190
OK, so the question is, and you'll have
34 seconds to come up with your answer.

1359
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,460
This is a real question
by one of your classmates.

1360
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,140
Here we go.

1361
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:11,290
The creator of a hybrid language
allowing users to meld HTML and Python

1362
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:14,308
had what color hair?

1363
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:17,780
[MUSIC - "THINK!"]

1364
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:47,120


1365
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,760
All right, so we're going
to take a look first

1366
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,020
at staff, who were trailing with $3,400.

1367
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,860
They wagered, turns out, all of it.

1368
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,500
And answered red hair.

1369
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:07,880
The students meanwhile, at $5,000
wagered $1,900 and went with brown.

1370
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,560
I think we're going to need to have
the audience decide whether or not

1371
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,610
the staff's answer is correct, because
according to your classmate who gave us

1372
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,180
the question, the creator of a hybrid
language allowing users to meld

1373
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:23,510
HTML and Python had what color hair?

1374
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,135
The answer is ginger.

1375
01:02:25,135 --> 01:02:28,480


1376
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,700
So congratulations to both
staff and to students.

1377
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,020
Thank you so much for
a wonderful semester.

1378
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,810
Cake is now served
downstairs in the pub.

1379
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,530
We'll see you at the hackathon and fair.

1380
01:02:41,530 --> 00:00:00,000
